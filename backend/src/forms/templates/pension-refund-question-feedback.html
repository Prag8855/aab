<p>Hi {{ message.refund_question.name|default:"there" }},</p>

<p>A week ago, you asked a question about pension refunds on All About Berlin.</p>

<p>If you have time, I would like some feedback. I only have 3 questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Are you happy with the help you received?</li>
	<li>What can I explain better in my guides?</li>
	<li>How can we make it easier to get a pension refund?</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all! Thanks for taking the time to answer. It's really helpful.</p>

<p>Kind regards,<br>Nicolas Bouliane, All About Berlin</p>
