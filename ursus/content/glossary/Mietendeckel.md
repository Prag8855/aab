The rent cap (*Mietendeckel*) was a rent control law in Berlin. It set rent limits in each area, and it stopped all rent increases for 5 years. If a landlord charged too much rent, they could get a big fine.

 It came in effect on January 30 2020, but it was repealed in court on April 15 2021.

The *Mietendeckel* is not the same as the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]*, another rent control law.
