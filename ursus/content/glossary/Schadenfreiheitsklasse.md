German insurance companies give every driver class (*Schadenfreiheitsklasse*). If you don't make any insurance claims, your *Schadenfreiheitsklasse* gets higher every year. A high *Schadenfreiheitsklasse* means that you are a safe driver. If you have a high *Schadenfreiheitsklasse*, you pay less for insurance.
