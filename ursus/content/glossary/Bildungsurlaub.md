In Germany, the *Bildungsurlaub* is a paid education leave. It lets you leave work to get professional training. During that time, you still get paid.

Educational leave is a right. Your employer must allow it, unless it conflicts with the business operations, or if over 50% of the employees already took their *Bildungsurlaub*.
