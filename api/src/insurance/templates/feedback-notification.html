<p>Hi {{ message.case.insured_persons.first.first_name|default:"there" }},</p>

<p>A week ago, you asked a health insurance question on All About Berlin.</p>

<p>If you have two minutes, I would love a bit of feedback.</p>

<ol>
	<li>What confused or frustrated you about health insurance?</li>
	<li>Did your conversation with {{ message.case.broker_info.first_name }} help?</li>
	<li>What can I explain better in my guides?</li>
	<li>How can we make it easier to get insurance?</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all! Thanks for taking the time to answer. It's really helpful.</p>

<p>Kind regards,<br>Nicolas Bouliane, All About Berlin</p>
