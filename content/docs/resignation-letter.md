## How to write a resignation letter

Use my German resignation letter generator.

Your resignation letter must be short and precise. Don't add unnecessary information; it could be used against you.[^10]

Your resignation letter must include:

- [ ] Your full name and address
- [ ] Your employer's full name and address
- [ ] The date of your resignation
- [ ] The word *Kündigung* in the subject line
- [ ] The correct addressee - This is usually your manager, or the human resources department.[^7]
- [ ] Your signature - Sign the letter by hand. A digital signature, a scanned signature, initials or a stamp are not enough.[^11]

Your resignation letter can include:

- [ ] Your contact information, if your employer needs to contact you later
- [ ] Your employee number, if you have one
- [ ] A request for a reference letter (*[[Arbeitszeugnis]]*)
- [ ] A request for an *[[Urlaubsbescheinigung]]*
- [ ] A note to thank your employer and your team

Your resignation letter should **not** include:

- Why you quit your job[^6]
- What you plan to do next
- Feedback for your employer or your team

### Language of your resignation letter

Write your resignation letter in German. If you work in an English-speaking office, you can write your resignation letter in English, but German is safer.[^9]

## How to give your resignation letter

Your resignation letter must be **printed and signed**. An email, a fax, an instant message or a conversation is not enough.[^1] Your resignation is only official when your employer receives your resignation letter.[^12]

There are 2 ways to give your resignation letter.

- **In person** (recommended)[^8]{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    Give your resignation letter to your employer in person. Bring a witness that saw the letter and can confirm that it was delivered.[^5] If you have a witness, you can guarantee that your employer received your resignation. If the witness has a copy, they can confirm what was in your resignation letter.
- **By post**  
    If you live far away, send your resignation letter by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief) with proof of delivery (*Einwurf-Einschreiben*). Never use registered mail with receipt (*Einschreiben mit Rückschein*) because your employer can refuse the letter.[^3] This can delay your resignation.

Your employer does not need to confirm or accept your resignation. 

### Who should receive the letter

**Ask your employer.** You usually give the resignation letter to your manager, or to the human resources department.

## What happens next

When your employer receives your resignation letter, your notice period (*Kündigungsfrist*) begins.

Keep a copy of your resignation letter. The *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* asks for it when you [apply for unemployment benefits](/guides/unemployment-benefits).[^2]
