All EU insurance policies come with an Insurance Product Information Document (IPID)[^0]. This is a one-page summary of what your insurance covers.

When you [choose health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance) or [liability insurance](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung), you should always read the IPID.
