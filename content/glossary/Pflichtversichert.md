If you are an employee, and you make under {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year, you are compulsorily insured (*Pflichtversichert*). This means that [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) companies must accept you, even if you are very sick. It also means that you can't have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).

When you are not *Pflichtversichert*, you are voluntarily insured ([*freiwillig versichert*](/glossary/freiwillig%20versichert)). Public health insurers do not have to accept voluntarily insured people. Students and freelancers are *freiwillig versichert*.
