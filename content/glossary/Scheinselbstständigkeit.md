Some employers hire employees, but treat them like freelancers to avoid paying social benefits. This is called fake self-employment or pseudo self-employment (*Scheinselbstständigkeit*), and it's illegal.

Generally, you are not self-employed if...[^0]

- You only have one client.
- You are integrated in your client's business.
- You always work at the same location. You can't choose where you work.
- You have a fixed salary.
- You do not use your own equipment.
