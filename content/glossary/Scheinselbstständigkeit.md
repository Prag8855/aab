Some employers hire "freelancers", but treat them like employees. This is called fake self-employment (*Scheinselbstständigkeit*).

Generally, you are not self-employed if...[^0]

- You only have one client.
- You are integrated in your client's business.
- You always work at the same location.
- You have a fixed salary.
- You do not use your own equipment.
