A sick note (*Krankschreibung*, *Arbeitsunfähigkeitsbescheinigung*, *AU-Bescheinigung* or *gelber Schein*) is a document you get from a doctor. It confirms that you are sick, and that you should get sick leave.

Most German employers ask for a sick note if you are sick for more than 3 days.[^0]

You can get a sick note by visiting a doctor, with a phone call, or with a video call. The [TeleClinic](https://www.teleclinic.com/) app let you schedule a video call with a doctor. It's only in German, but some doctors speak English.

There are 4 copies of a sick note:

- For you
- For your employer
- For your health insurance
- For your doctor
