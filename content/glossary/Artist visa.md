The artist visa does not exist. It's just a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).

In Berlin and Hamburg, freelance artists and journalists sometimes get a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) faster. They get their freelance visa during their *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* interview, instead of waiting a few months.

You must apply for a freelance visa at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, or at the German embassy or consulate in your home country.
