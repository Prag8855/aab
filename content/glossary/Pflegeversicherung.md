Nursing care insurance (*Pflegeversicherung*) is something you pay when you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) in Germany.

If you are under 23 years old, or you have children, it costs {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_NO_SURCHARGE}}% of your income. If you are over 22 years old, and you don't have children, it costs {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_WITH_SURCHARGE}}% of your income. If you earn more than {{GKV_HÖCHSTBEITRAG_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year, you pay the maximum amount: {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_NO_SURCHARGE}}% or {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_WITH_SURCHARGE}}% of {{GKV_HÖCHSTBEITRAG_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€.

When you are an employee, your employer pays half of your *Pflegeversicherung*.

If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), *Pflegeversicherung* is part of your insurance policy.
