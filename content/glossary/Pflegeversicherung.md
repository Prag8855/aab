If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), you also pay for nursing care insurance (*Pflegeversicherung*). It pays for your healthcare when you are old.

*Pflegeversicherung* costs {{ PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MIN_RATE }}% to {{ PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MAX_RATE }}% of your income. If you have a job, your employer pays {{ PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_EMPLOYER_RATE }}% and you pay the rest.

If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), *Pflegeversicherung* is included in your insurance policy. The cost is set by the company; it's not a percentage of your income.
