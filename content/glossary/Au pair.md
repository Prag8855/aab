An au pair is a person who lives and work for a host family, usually in another country. Au pairs usually do housework and take care of children. In return, they get a place to live, and a small allowance. In Germany, the minimum allowance is 280€ per month.[^0]

Au pair is a form of cultural exchange. It's a cheap way to live in another country and learn the local language. It's usually a part-time job. In Germany, au pairs can work up to 6 hours a day, or 30 hours a week.[^0] They must get at least 1 day off every week.
