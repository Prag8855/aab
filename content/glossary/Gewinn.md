Profit (*Gewinn*) is how much money you make after expenses. Profit is not the same as revenue (*[[Umsatz]]*).

For example, you have a product that costs €6 to make, and sells for €10. Your revenue is €10 per unit, and your profit is €4 per unit.

You only pay [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) and [trade tax](/glossary/Gewerbesteuer) on your profit, not your revenue.
