A Category D visa is a type of German visa. It's also called a [[National Visa]]. It lets you enter Germany to work, study or start a business.

You must apply for a Category D visa at the German embassy or consulate in your home country.

The Category D visa is only valid for 3 to 12 months. You must convert it to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* after you arrive in Germany.

The [[Schengen visa]] is not a Category D visa.
