A Category D visa is a type of German visa. It's also called a [[National Visa]]. It lets you enter Germany to work, study or start a business. The Category D visa is only valid for up to 12 months. It must be converted to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

The [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa) is not a Category D visa.
