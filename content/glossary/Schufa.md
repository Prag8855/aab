*SCHUFA* is a credit rating agency in Germany. They give a credit score to German residents. If you have a good Schufa score, it's easier to [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) or get a loan. If you have a bad Schufa, some banks don't let you [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany).

When you [apply for an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#what-to-bring-to-the-visit), you should include a *SCHUFA-Bonitätsauskunft* (credit report) with your application. This document shows your credit score.
