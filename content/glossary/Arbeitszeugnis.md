A job reference letter (*Arbeitszeugnis*) is a letter you get from your employer after you [leave a job](/guides/losing-your-job). It's a proof of the work you did for this employer.

This letter usually explains when you worked for the employer, and what type of work you did. A qualified reference (*qualifiziertes Arbeitszeugnis*) also includes an evaluation of your performance, and the reason you left the company.[^2]

When you leave a job, your employer is required to give you an *Arbeitszeugnis*.[^1]
