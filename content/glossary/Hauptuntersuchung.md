In Germany, vehicles must be inspected regularly - usually every 2 years. If a vehicle does not pass inspection, it can't drive on Germany roads. The inspection is very thorough. They check everything: lights, brakes, seats, seatbelts, horn, leaks, emissions, and much more.

This inspection is called the *Hauptuntersuchung*, but people sometimes call it *TÜV*. TÜV and Dekra are the authorities that inspect German vehicles.
