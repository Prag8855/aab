The freelance visa is a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) for self-employment in Germany.

With a freelance visa, you can...

- Live in Germany
- [Start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or [become a freelancer](/guides/self-employment)
- Bring your family to Germany
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa
- Become a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 3 to 5 years

The [artist visa](/glossary/Artist%20visa) and the language teacher visa are the same thing as the freelance visa. The application process is the same.

You must apply for a freelance visa at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, or at the German embassy or consulate in your home country.
