Revenue (*Umsatz*) is how much money you earn, ignoring expenses. It's not the same as profit (*[[Gewinn]]*).

Let's say you have a product that costs 6€ to make, and sells for 10€. If you sell 100 units, your total revenue is 1,000€, but your profit is only 400€. The other 600€ are your business expenses.
