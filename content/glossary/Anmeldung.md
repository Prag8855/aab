In Germany, you must register your address at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. This will become your official address in Germany. This is called the *Anmeldung*.

During the *Anmeldung* appointment, you get a registration certificate (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*). This document confirms your official address in Germany. You often need it to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany) or get a cellphone contract. After your first *Anmeldung*, you will also get a tax ID (*[[Steueridentifikationsnummer]]*).
