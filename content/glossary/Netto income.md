Your net income (*Nettoeinkommen*) is your income after taxes, [health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance) and social security contributions. It's the part of your paycheck that you keep.

On average, your *Netto* income is around 65% of your *Brutto* income[^0]. Use a tax calculator to know the exact number.
