Business-to-business (B2B) is when a business sells goods or services to another business. It's the opposite of business-to-consumer ([[B2C]]) transactions.

Example B2B transactions:

- A store sells computers to another business
- An agency hires a freelance writer
- A mechanic repairs a company car

When we talk about [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer), a B2C transaction is a sale to another business that charges VAT. The VAT rules for B2B transactions are different from B2C transactions.
