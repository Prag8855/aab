A Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) made it easier to sell digital products and services in other EU countries. Instead of registering for [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) in every EU country where you had customers, you only registered for VAT in your country.

In July 2021, the Mini One Stop Shop was **replaced by the One Stop Shop (OSS)**. It works the same way, but it also covers physical goods and other services.
