In Germany, work days (*Werktage*) usually mean Monday to Saturday, excluding official holidays.[^0] This is true for traffic signs, mail delivery, and most other situations.

This is different from business days (*[Arbeitstage](/glossary/Arbeitstag)*), which usually mean Monday to Friday, excluding holidays.

On apartment leases, it means Monday to Friday, excluding official holidays.[^1]
