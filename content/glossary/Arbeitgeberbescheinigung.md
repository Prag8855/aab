A certificate of employment (*Arbeitgeberbescheinigung*) proves that you work for your employer. It describes your job, your responsibilities, your salary and other details.

You can request an *Arbeitgeberbescheinigung* from your employer. It has no specific format. You might need it to renew your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), or to [apply for permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence). You can also use it as a proof of income when you [apply for an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#apply-for-the-apartment).[^1]

The *Arbeitgeberbescheinigung* is not the same thing as the *[[Arbeitsbescheinigung]]*.[^2]
