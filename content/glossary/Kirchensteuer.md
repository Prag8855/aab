In Germany, churches can collect taxes from their members. This is called the church tax (*Kirchensteuer*). Around half of German tax payers pay the church tax.[^0]

The church tax is 8% of your income tax in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, and 9% in the rest of Germany.[^2] If you earn 50,000€/year in Berlin, you would pay around 800€ in church tax. Use my [tax calculator](/tools/tax-calculator) to know how much church tax you should pay.

These religious communities collect a church tax:[^3]

- The Evangelical Church (*Evangelische Kirche*)
- The Roman Catholic Church (*Römisch-katholische Kirche*)
- The Jewish Community (*Jüdische Gemeinde*)
- The Old Catholic Church (*Altkatholische Kirche*)
- Various Free Religious communities (*Freireligiöse Gemeinden*)

If you are not a member these religious communities, you don't pay the church tax.[^1] If you are, the only way to [stop paying the church tax](https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/stop-paying-german-church-tax/) is to leave the church. You declare your religion during your *[Anmeldung](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin).* If you were baptized in your home country, the church can tax you [even if you registered as an atheist](https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/expats-beware-germany-church-tax-922429).
