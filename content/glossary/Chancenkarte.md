The opportunity card (*Chancenkarte*) is a type of [[National Visa]]. It allows you to stay in Germany for 12 months to [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). It mostly replaces the [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa).

The opportunity card lets you work 20 hours per week while you look for a full time job.[^1] To work full time, you must get a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]].

The opportunity card does not allow self-employment, but you can convert it to a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).[^2]

You must apply for a job seeker visa at the German embassy or consulate in your home country.
