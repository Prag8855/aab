The opportunity card (*Chancenkarte*) is a [[National Visa]]. It allows you to come to Germany to [look for a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). It mostly replaces the [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa).

With an opportunity card, you can...

- Come to Germany to look for a job
- Stay in Germany for up to 12 months
- Work for up to 20 hours per week[^1]

You must apply for an opportunity card at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, or at the German embassy or consulate in your home country. After you find a job, you must convert your opportunity card to a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]].

The opportunity card does not allow self-employment, but you can convert it to a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).[^2]
