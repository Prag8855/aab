IBAN means International Bank Account Number. It's a bank account's unique number. IBANs are used to make [SEPA transfers](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung).

IBANs have the format **DE 1234 5678 9012 3456 7890 12**. The first two letters are the country code of the bank. A German IBAN starts with "DE". A French IBAN starts with "FR". Use [this tool](https://www.iban.com/) to check if an IBAN is valid.

You can find your own IBAN on your *[[Girocard]]*, in your banking app, or on your online banking platform.
