If you are voluntarily insured (*freiwillig versichert*), you can choose [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).

You are *freiwillig versichert* if...

- You are an employee, and you earn over €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year
- or you are self-employed
- or you are a student
