If you are a freelancer, or if you make over {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year, you are voluntarily insured (*freiwillig versichert*). This means that public health insurance companies are not forced to accept you. It also means that you can choose private health insurance. Teachers and students are also voluntarily insured.
