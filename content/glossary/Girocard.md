Girocard (*Girokarte* or *EC-Karte*) is a type of debit card in Germany. You can use it to buy things.

Girocard is still an important payment system in Germany. Many German businesses accept cash and Girocard, but not Visa and Mastercard. This is because businesses pay higher fees for Visa and Mastercard payments.[^0]
