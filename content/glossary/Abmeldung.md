When you move out of Germany, you must deregister your address. This is called the *Abmeldung*. After you deregister, you stop paying for health insurance and TV tax. You also receive a deregistration certificate (*[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*).

In Berlin, you can do your *Abmeldung* in person at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*, by post or by email.
