Germany has two types of [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung): public and [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). Most people have public health insurance (*gesetzliche Krankenversicherung* or *GKV*). It's also called statutory health insurance.

Public health insurance is managed by non-profit *[Krankenkassen](/glossary/Krankenkasse)*. There are dozens of options, but the cost and the coverage are almost the same. The cost of public health insurance is based on your income.
