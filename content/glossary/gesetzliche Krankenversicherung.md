Public health insurance or statutory health insurance (*gesetzliche Krankenversicherung* or *GKV*) pays for your healthcare when you need it. It's also called statutory health insurance. Public health insurance companies are called [*Krankenkassen*](/glossary/Krankenkasse).

89% of Germans have public health insurance. The rest have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) instead.

Public health insurance costs a percentage of your income. If you earn more, you pay more. The cost does not depend on how healthy you are.
