A blocking account (*Sperrkonto*) is a special type of bank account. A *Sperrkonto* is a requirement when applying for certain visas and [residence permits](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).

Unlike a normal bank account, a blocked account only lets you withdraw a fixed amount every month.

[Coracle](/out/coracle), [Fintiba](/out/fintiba), [Expatrio](/out/expatrio-sperrkonto) and *some* Sparkasse branches offer blocking accounts. Deutsche Bank stopped offering them.[^0]
