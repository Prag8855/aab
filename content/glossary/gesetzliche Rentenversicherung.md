All employees in Germany pay for public pension insurance (*gesetzliche Rentenversicherung*). For self-employed people, pension insurance is optional.

Pension insurance pays for your pension. When you retire, you will get a monthly pension from the state.

Public pension insurance costs {{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_TOTAL_CONTRIBUTION}}% of your income. You pay {{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_EMPLOYEE_CONTRIBUTION}}%, and your employer pays the rest. It's taken directly from your paycheck.

If you are self-employed, you pay the full {{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_TOTAL_CONTRIBUTION}}% yourself, unless you join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* or a freelancer cooperative.

If you leave Germany, you can sometimes [get your pension payments back](/guides/pension-payments-refund).
