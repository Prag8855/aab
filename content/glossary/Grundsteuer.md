The property tax (*Grundsteuer*, sometimes *Bodenzins*) is a tax home every home owner in Germany must pay. The property tax is 0.26% to 1% of the value of the property, every year.[^0] It varies depending on the type of property, and the state you live in.

If you are renting, you do not need to pay property tax.
