A *Postleitzahl* or *PLZ* is a German post code or zip code. It has 5 digits. For example, the post code of the Brandenburg Gate is 10117.

Always include the *Postleitzahl* when you [write a German address](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany). In big cities, two streets can have the same name. The only difference is their post code.
