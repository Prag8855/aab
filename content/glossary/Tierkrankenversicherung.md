Pet health insurance (*Tierkrankenversicherung* or *Hundekrankenversicherung*) covers the veterinary bills if your pet gets sick. Usually, it does not cover routine operations like vaccines or castration.[^0] However, it covers expensive operations. This can be important when your dog gets old.

The price of pet insurance depends on the age, race and sex of your dog. It costs around €20 per month if your dog is still young.
