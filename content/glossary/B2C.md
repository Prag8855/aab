Business-to-consumer (B2C) is when a business sells goods or services directly to a consumer, not to another business. It's the opposite of business-to-business ([[B2B]]) transactions.

Example B2C transactions:

- A store sells a computer to a consumer
- An artist sells a painting to tourist

When charging [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer), B2C transactions are treated differently from B2B transactions.

When we talk about [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer), a B2C transaction is a sale to a customer that does not charge VAT. For example, a business sells a computer to a person, or a mechanic repairs a person's car.
