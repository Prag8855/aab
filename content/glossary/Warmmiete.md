The warm rent (*Warmmiete*) is the total amount of rent you pay every month. It's the amount you pay to your landlord every month. The cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) + the utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*) = the warm rent (*Warmmiete*).

The *Warmmiete* does not include electricity for the lights and appliances. You must choose an electricity company yourself.
