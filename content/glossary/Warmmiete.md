The warm rent (*Warmmiete*) is the rent you pay every month. It includes utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*).

> Cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) + utilities = warm rent

If you use more water or heating, your utility costs (*[[Nebenkosten]]*) can go up. This is why your warm rent can change every year, even if your cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) is the same.
