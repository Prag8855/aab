When you make a tax declaration, the *[[Finanzamt]]* sends you a *[[Steuerbescheid]]* by post. It looks like [this](/images/Einkommensteuer-Bescheid-Muster-Example.png).

This document shows how much money you earn, so it's often used as a proof of income. It also shows how much [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) you owe.
