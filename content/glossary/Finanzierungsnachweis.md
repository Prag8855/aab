A proof of financial resources (*Finanzierungsnachweis*) is required when applying for foreign student, au-pair, language student and job-seeker visas. 

Usually, this means you must open a blocking account (*[[Sperrkonto]]*). [Coracle](/out/coracle), [Fintiba](/out/fintiba), [Expatrio](/out/expatrio) and *some* Sparkasse branches offer blocking accounts.
