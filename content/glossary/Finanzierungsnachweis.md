A proof of financial resources (*Finanzierungsnachweis*) is required when applying for foreign student, au-pair, language student and job-seeker visas. Usually, this means you have to open a blocking account (*[[Sperrkonto]]*). [Fintiba](/out/fintiba) and [Expatrio](https://www.expatrio.com/blocked-account) offer blocking accounts.
