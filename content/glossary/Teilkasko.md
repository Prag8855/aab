*Teilkasko* car insurance only covers the damage to other people and vehicles. If you cause an accident, your *Teilkasko* will pay to fix other people's cars, but it will not pay you to on your own car. If the accident is someone else's fault, *their* insurance will pay for the repairs on your car. It also covers certain things like theft, broken windows and natural catastrophes.
