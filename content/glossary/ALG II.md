Welfare (*Arbeitslosengeld II*, *ALG II* or *Hartz IV*) is a type of financial assistance in Germany. The official name is *Arbeitslosengeld II*, but it's often called *Hartz IV*.[^0]

You only get *ALG II* when you have nothing left: no property, no savings, no private pensions. *ALG II* is your last protection against poverty, homelessness and bankruptcy.[^1]

You apply for *ALG II* at the Jobcenter. When you receive *ALG II*, the government also pays for your health insurance.[^0]

*ALG II* is not unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is called *[[ALG I]]*.
