Welfare (*Arbeitslosengeld II*, *ALG II* or *Hartz IV*) was a type of financial assistance in Germany. The official name is *Arbeitslosengeld II*, but it was often called *Hartz IV*.[^0]

It was replaced by *Bürgergeld* in 2023.

*ALG II* and *Bürgergeld* are not unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are called *[[ALG I]]*.
