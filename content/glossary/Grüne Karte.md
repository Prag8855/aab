A Green Card (*Grüne Karte*) is a document that lists the countries where your car insurance is valid. When you cross a border with your vehicle, you usually need to show your Green Card. [This map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Motor_Insurance_Card_System#/media/File:International_Motor_Insurance_Systems.png) shows where the Green Card is accepted.

You can request a Green Card from your car insurance company. This is usually free.[^0]
