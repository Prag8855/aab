Your tax class (*Steuerklasse*) decides how much [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer) you pay. It does not affect how much [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) you pay. It only affects how much income tax you pay *in advance*, as salary tax.

There are 6 tax classes (*Steuerklassen*).

- **Tax class 1**  
    If you are not married, and you are not in any other tax class.
- **Tax class 2**  
    If you are not married, and you raise children alone. You get more tax benefits.
- **Tax class 3**  
    If you are married, and you earn more than your spouse. If you are in tax class 3, your spouse is in tax class 5.
- **Tax class 4**  
    If you are married, and you and your spouse have similar incomes. If you are in tax class 4, your spouse is also in tax class 4.
- **Tax class 5**  
    If you are married, and you earn less than your spouse. If you are in tax class 5, your spouse is in tax class 3.
- **Tax class 6**  
    This is the tax class for a second job. If you don't have a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer), your employer might put you in tax class 6. You have no tax benefits, and you pay more [salary tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).

Your tax class depends on your situation. If you are self-employed, you usually don't have a tax class, because you don't pay salary tax.
