Income tax (*Einkommensteuer*) is the percentage of your income that goes to the German tax office (*[[Finanzamt]]*). The amount of income tax you pay depends on your total income. The maximum income tax rate in Germany is {{INCOME_TAX_MAX_RATE}}%.[^0]

The income tax is not the same as the salary tax (*[[Lohnsteuer]]*).
