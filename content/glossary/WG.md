A *WG* or *Wohngemeinschaft* is an apartment where multiple people live together and share the rent. It's called a shared apartment or flatshare in English. Living in a WG is a good way to save on rent. Most WGs are listed on [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/) and [Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/). For more details, see [this guide](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin).

A *[[Zweck-WG]]* is a *WG* where people live together to save money, not to be friends.
