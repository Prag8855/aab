The imprint (*Impressum*) is a page on a website. It shows important information about the owners of the website: their address, their contact information, their *[VAT ID](/glossary/Umsatzsteuernummer)* and their *[[Handelsregisternummer]]*.

In Germany, all commercial websites must have an *Impressum* page. This page must be easy to find. Usually, you find a link to the *Impressum* at the bottom of every page.
