The vaccination pass (*Impfpass* or *Impfausweis*) is a [small yellow book](https://www.google.com/search?q=Impfausweis&tbm=isch) that shows which vaccines you received. You can get one for free from your doctor, or from the *Gesundheitsamt*. You can also [buy it online](https://amzn.to/3vINFmY) or at any Apotheke.[^0]
