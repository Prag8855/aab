The utilities bill (*Nebenkostenabrechnung* or *Betriebskostenabrechnung*) is calculated every year. It shows how much hot water and electricity you really used.

You already pay the *estimated* utility costs (*[[Nebenkosten]]*) every month with the rent. If you used more than you paid for, you get an invoice. If you used less, you get money back.

After you [move out of an apartment](/guides/moving-out), the landlord waits until the *Nebenkostenabrechnung* to [return your deposit](/guides/mietkaution#when-do-i-get-my-kaution-back) (*[[Kaution]]*).
