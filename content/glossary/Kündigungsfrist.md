The notice period (*Kündigungsfrist*) is how long you need to cancel a contract, fire an employee, or quit your job.

All jobs have a notice period, both for the employee (when they quit) and the employer (when they fire someone)[^0]. It depends on your work contract, and how long you work at that company.

Many other contracts have a notice period. For example, if you want to leave your apartment, you must tell your landlord 3 months in advance. There is a *Kündigungsfrist* of 3 months.

In some cases, you can cancel a contract early if there is a price increase, or if you move to an address where the service is not available[^1]. This is called a *Sonderkündigung*.
