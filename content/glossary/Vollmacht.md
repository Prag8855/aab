The power of attorney (*Vollmacht*) is a document that gives another person (usually a lawyer or a tax advisor) the legal right to act in your name. This allows other people to handle legal matters for you. You need a *Vollmacht* to let someone else file your taxes for you, represent you in legal cases, do the [*Anmeldung*](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin) for you, apply for a [[Kitagutschein]] for you etc.
