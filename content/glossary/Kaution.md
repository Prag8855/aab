The apartment deposit (*Kaution*, *Mietkaution* or *Mietsicherheit*) is an amount you give to your landlord when you sign an apartment contract. When you leave the apartment, this amount will be returned to you, with interests. If you broke something in the apartment, the landlord can use the money from your *Kaution* to fix it

In Germany, the *Kaution* is usually 3 times your monthly rent (*[Kaltmiete](/glossary/Abmeldung)*). This is the legal maximum.
