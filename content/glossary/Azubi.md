An apprentice (*Azubi* or *Auszubildender*) is a student who must complete an apprenticeship (*Ausbildung*) to graduate.[^0] *Azubis* learn their job by doing it.

Azubis are not the same as working students (*Werkstudents*). Working students are students with a part time job. *Azubis* are workers in training. Their job is part of their studies.
