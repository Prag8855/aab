Glass recycling bins (*Altglascontainer, Glastonne* or *Glasiglu*) are recycling bins for glass. You can find them around your neighbourhood. Some apartment buildings have their own glass recycling bins.

 There are usually 3 bins:

- **Brown bin** (*Braunglas*) for the brown glass
- **Green bin** (*Grunglas*) for the green glass
- **White bin** (*Weißglas*) for transparent glass
