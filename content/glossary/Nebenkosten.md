These utility costs (*Nebenkosten*) are included in your [warm rent](/glossary/Warmmiete):

- Heating
- Hot water (most of the time)
- Trash collection
- Cleaning and landscaping

You pay the *estimated* utility costs every month with the rent. Every year, your landlord calculates the real costs, and sends you a bill (the *[[Nebenkostenabrechnung]]*). If you paid too much *Nebenkosten*, you get money back. If you did not pay enough, you get an invoice.
