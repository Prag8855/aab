The cost of [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) is based on your income. If you have a low income, your health insurance is cheaper.

The *Mindestbeitrag* is the minimum cost for public health insurance. If you earn less than €{{GKV_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per month, the price does not go lower. The maximum cost is called the *[[Höchstbeitrag]]*.

The *Mindestbeitrag* for employees is €{{GKV_MIN_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}} per month. The *Mindestbeitrag* for students, unemployed and self-employed people is €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. You might also get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

There is no *Mindestbeitrag* for private health insurance, because the price is not based on your income. It's sometimes cheaper than public health insurance.
