The price of [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) is based on your income. If you earn less money, you pay less for your health insurance.

The *Mindestbeitrag* is the minimum amount you can pay for health insurance. If you earn less than {{GKV_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, the price stops going down.[^0]

There is a different *Mindestbeitrag* for students over 30 years old and freelancers, the *Selbstständige Mindestbeitrag*. It's around {{GKV_ESTIMATED_MIN_CONTRIBUTION|cur}}€.
