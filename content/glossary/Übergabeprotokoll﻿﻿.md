The *Übergabeprotokoll* is a document you fill with your landlord when you [move in](/guides/moving-in) or [move out](/guides/moving-out) of an apartment. It describes the condition of the apartment, and the things that must be repaired. It also contains the numbers on your electricity meter. You must give those numbers to the electricity company.

The *Übergabeprotokoll* can have any format. You can even create your own. It usually looks like [this](/images/ubergabeprotokoll-germany.jpg).
