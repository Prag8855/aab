Home contents insurance or household insurance (*Hausratversicherung*) insures your furniture, your appliances, and the other movable things in your house.

For example:[^0]

- There is a fire on your building, and you lose everything you have.
- A water leak destroys your furniture and electronics.
- A thief breaks into your house and steals your things.

It sometimes covers laptops and bicycles away from home. It sometimes covers calling a locksmith when you lock yourself out.

Household insurance costs around €5 per month. 76% of Germans have it.[^1]
