A *Werkstattbindung* is an option for your car insurance. With a *Werkstattbindung*, you can save up to 20% on your car insurance.[^0] In many cases, you also get a free rental car while they repair your vehicle. However, if you have an accident, you must repair your car at a garage approved by your insurer.

This option is only available for *Teilkasko* and *Vollkasko* insurance.[^1] *Haftpflicht* insurance does not cover repairs to your own vehicle.
