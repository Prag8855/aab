The German work visa (*Aufenthaltserlaubnis zur Aufnahme einer Beschäftigung*) is a type of [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). It's also called a work permit.

With a work visa, you can...

- Live and work anywhere in Germany
- Bring your family to Germany
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa
- Become a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 2 to 3 years

The work visa is similar to a [[Blue Card]], but the requirements are different.

You must apply for a work visa at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, or at the German embassy or consulate in your home country.
