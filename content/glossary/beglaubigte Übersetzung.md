A certified translation (*beglaubigte Übersetzung*) is verified by a state-certified translator. The translator confirms that the translation is accurate, and that it can be trusted.

When someone wants a document, but it's in a language they don't understand, you need a certified translation. For example, a Russian birth certificate or a Chinese marriage certificate.

You can get certified translations from [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified), [Lingoking](/out/lingoking) or [Linguidoor](/out/linguidoor).
