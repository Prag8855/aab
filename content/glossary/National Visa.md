A National Visa (also known as Type D or [[Category D visa]]) is a visa that lets you enter Germany to work, study or start a business. When you arrive to Germany, you must convert your National Visa into a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. National Visas are valid for up to 12 months.[^1]

The [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa) is not a National Visa.
