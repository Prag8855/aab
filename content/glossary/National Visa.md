A National Visa is a type of German visa. It's also called a [[Category D visa]]. It lets you enter Germany to [work](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), study or [start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany). It's valid for 3 to 12 months.[^1] You must convert it to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* after you arrive in Germany.

The [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa) is not a National Visa.
