A National Visa (or Category D visa) lets you move to Germany and start working or studying. It's valid for 3 to 12 months.[^1]

You apply for a National Visa at the German embassy or consulate in your home country. When you arrive in Germany, you must [convert it into a residence permit](/guides/residence-permit#convert-your-national-visa) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you do not need a National Visa. You can visit Germany without a visa. You still need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live, work or study in Germany.

The [[Schengen visa]] is not a National Visa.
