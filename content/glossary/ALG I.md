When you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you can get financial help from the state. It's called *Arbeitslosengeld I* or *ALG I*. You apply for *ALG I* at the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]*.

You only get *ALG I* if you pay [unemployment insurance](/glossary/Arbeitslosenversicherung). Almost all employees pay for unemployment insurance, because it's mandatory. self-employed people rarely pay for unemployment insurance, because it's optional.
