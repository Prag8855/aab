Unemployment benefits (*Arbeitslosengeld I* or *ALG I*) is a type of social assistance in Germany.

You get *ALG I* when you lose your job. You only get *ALG 1* if you have paid unemployment insurance for at least 12 months in the last 30 months[^0]. You must apply for *ALG I* at the *[Bundesagentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit%E2%80%8B)*[^1].

Most employees must pay for [unemployment insurance](/glossary/Arbeitslosenversicherung). If you are self-employed, unemployment insurance is optional[^2]. This means that most unemployed people can't get *ALG I*.

 *ALG I* pays 60% to 67% of your previous salary, up to ~2000€ per month[^3]. It also pays for your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung).
