Unemployment benefits (*Arbeitslosengeld I* or *ALG I*) is a type of social assistance for unemployed people.

You get *ALG I* when you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job). You must apply for it at the *[[Bundesagentur für Arbeit]]*. Unemployment benefits are covered by the [unemployment insurance](/glossary/Arbeitslosenversicherung) you pay as an employee. If you are self-employed, unemployment insurance is optional.[^0] This means that most self-employed people can't get *ALG I*.
