The EU Blue Card (*Blaue Karte*) is a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that allows you to live and work in Germany. You can also get a Blue Card in other European Union countries.

The Blue Card is a type of [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). It is not the same as a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa), but it's similar.
