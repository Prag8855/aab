If you have German permanent residency (*Niederlassungserlaubnis*), you can live, work, study and start a business in Germany. It's sometimes called a settlement permit.

Permanent residency is better than a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), because you never need to renew it. It lets you stay in Germany permanently, even if you don't work or study.

Permanent residency is not as good as citizenship. It does not let you vote. You can still get deported. Your permanent residency expires if you leave Germany for more than 6 months.

There are two types of permanent residencies: the German permanent residency (*Niederlassungserlaubnis*), and the EU permanent residency (*Erlaubnis zum Daueraufenthalt-EU*). They have different requirements[^0].
