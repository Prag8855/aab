German permanent residence (*PR*, *permanent settlement permit* or *Niederlassungserlaubnis*) allows you to live, work and study in Germany. You can get permanent residence after living in Germany for 21 to 60 months.

It's better than a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) because...

- It's permanent. You don't need to renew it.
- It's flexible. It's not tied to your income or occupation.
- It's more trusted. It's easier to [rent an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) or get a mortgage.

It's not as good as German citizenship because...[^1]

- You can't vote in elections.
- If you leave Germany for a long time, you lose it.
- You can still get deported.
