In Germany, you cancel most contracts by sending a termination letter (*Kündigungsschreiben*). It's also called a termination notice or cancellation letter. This is how you resign from a job, [end your apartment lease](/guides/moving-out#end-your-lease), or cancel some memberships.

The *Kündigungsschreiben* is usually printed, signed, and sent by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief).
