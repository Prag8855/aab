The salary tax (*Lohnsteuer*) is a tax that your employer deducts from your paycheques. It's an advance payment of your *estimated* income tax (*[[Einkommensteuer]]*).

When you file a tax declaration ([[Steuererklärung]]), you calculate your real income tax. If you paid more salary tax than your real income tax, you will get money back.
