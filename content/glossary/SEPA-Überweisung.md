A *SEPA-Überweisung* is a bank transfer between two banks in Europe. They are the standard type of bank transfers in the European Union. SEPA transfers usually take less than 2 business days.

When you transfer money, you need the recipient's [[IBAN]]. You can also leave a reference message. The reference message can be an invoice number, the purpose of transaction, or anything else. You must also enter the recipient's name, but if you enter the wrong name, the money will still be transferred correctly.

You can make a SEPA transfer at the bank, in your banking app, or with online banking. You can also sign a [direct debit authorization](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).

To transfer money to a bank that does not support SEPA transfers, use [Wise](/out/transferwise), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) or wire transfers.
