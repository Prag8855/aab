Hi, I'm Nick, and I need to get out of Französisch Buchholz.

I am looking for an apartment somewhere in central Berlin. If you help me find a new home, I will give you a thousand euros.

## What I am looking for

Same thing, but more central. I want to live in Berlin, not commute to it.

These are my criteria:

- Over 45 m^2
- Up to 20€ per m^2
- Up to 1300€ warm
- Somewhat central
- Unlimited lease
- With a balcony

If you have anything like that, **[contact me](/contact#contact-information)**!

## About me

I moved to Berlin in 2015 to be a software engineer. I started this website in 2017, and I live from it since 2020.

I am legally and spiritually a permanent resident. I am overqualified for citizenship. I speak German.

I live alone, without pets. My loudest hobby is using a typewriter (never after 10 PM). My favourite place to party is elsewhere. My cooking smells great.

All of these statements are true and I have the paperwork to prove it.

## Help me find a flat, get 1,000€

If you help me find my new home, you get 1,000€ the day I sign the lease. 

Sounds good? If you see something, **[contact me](/contact#contact-information)**.
