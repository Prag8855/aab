Hi, I'm Nicolas. <mark>**I am currently on vacation**</mark> and I will not check my emails. You must [find someone else to help you](/guides/questions-about-berlin).

When I am back, you can contact me to...

- **Ask a question**  
    Please [ask the right people](/guides/questions-about-berlin) first. I would love to help you, but I get a lot of questions, and I don't have enough time to answer everyone. I can't give legal or financial advice. I can't answer visa and residence permit questions.
- **Give feedback**  
    If you have changes and suggestions to make, send them to me! It helps me improve the website for everyone.
- **Say thanks**  
    I *love* to hear from happy readers. It makes my day! You can also [leave a review on Google Maps](/google-maps) or [donate a few euros](/donate) to support the website.
- **Advertise your business**  
    Read my [content policy](/terms#content-policy) and my [advertising policy](/terms#advertising-policy) first. I sometimes work with advertisers, but not at the readers' expense.
    - **Therapists and psychiatrists**  
        Fill the [form for psychiatrists and therapists](/suggest-therapist). You will get listed for free.
    - **Doctors, lawyers, tax advisors, etc.**  
        Fill the [form for other businesses](/suggest-business). You will only get listed if it's relevant to my readers. It can take some time.
