Hi, I'm Nicolas Bouliane. I run All About Berlin since 2017, and it's my full-time job since 2020. I have built this website from scratch and written every word published on it.

The website is based on my experience as an immigrant. I settled in Berlin in 2015 and slowly learned my way through German bureaucracy. I set to make immigration easier for those who came after me. I explain my philosophy and approach [on my personal blog](https://nicolasbouliane.com/projects/all-about-berlin).

My work is supported by [donations from readers](/donate), and by affiliate links. There are no ads on the website; all recommendations are genuine. I give you the same advice I would give to my best friend.
