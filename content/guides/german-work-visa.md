This guide shows you how to apply for a German work visa or EU Blue Card.

- The **[German work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)** is a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that lets you work as an employee in Germany.
- The **[EU Blue Card](/glossary/Blue%20Card)** is like a work visa, but better. The application process is almost the same.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Who needs a work visa or Blue Card?

You **need** a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) if:

- You want to live and work in Germany
- **and** you are not a citizen or [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) of Germany, the [[European Union]], Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland
- **and** your current residence permit does not let you work in Germany. For example, the [German freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) lets you work as a freelancer, but not as an employee.

You **do not need** a residence permit if:

- You are a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) of Germany, or a citizen of the [[European Union]], Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland[^0]
- **or** your current residence permit lets you work in Germany. For example, the German [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa) lets you work up to 120 days or 240 half days per year.[^1]
- **or** you want to be self-employed. You need a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) for this.

[Use this tool](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/fuer-menschen-aus-dem-ausland/migration-check-english) to know if you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to work in Germany.

## Types of German work visas

There are many types of [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that let you to work in Germany. The work visa and the Blue Card are not your only options.

### Blue Card

**University graduates** can apply for an EU Blue Card instead of a work visa. The Blue Card is better than a work visa:

- **You can get it faster**  
    You don't need permission from the [[ZAV]] if your salary is over {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€. This makes the application process shorter.[^2]
- **It's easier to change jobs**  
    After 2 years with a Blue Card, you can change jobs without applying for a new Blue Card.[^3] This saves a lot of time. With the work visa, you must apply for a new visa every time you change jobs.[^35]
- **You can get your [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) faster**  
    With a Blue Card, you can get your permanent residence in 33 months[^4] instead of 60 months.[^5] If you get a B1 language certificate, you can get your permanent residence in 21 months.[^4]
- **It's easier to move to other EU countries**  
    You can move to other EU countries (except Denmark and Ireland[^38])) more easily. If you had a Blue Card for over 18 months, you can move to another EU country, and apply for the Blue Card there.[^6]
- **You can travel longer outside Germany**  
    With a Blue Card, you can leave Germany for 12 months before your residence permit becomes invalid.[^7] With a work visa, you can only leave for 6 months. If you want to leave longer, you can get special permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

The Blue Card has more requirements:

- **You need a high income**  
    You must make at least {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year (before taxes).[^8] If there is a shortage of skilled workers in your field, you must make at least {{BLUE_CARD_SHORTAGE_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year.[^9] [This list](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1978984/6037342/ISCO-08.pdf) shows which fields have a shortage of skilled workers.
- **You need a university degree**  
    Your degree must be recognised in Germany. It must be listed as equivalent (*entspricht* or *äquivalent*) in the [Anabin](https://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/hochschulabschluesse.html) database.[^10] In other EU countries, you can get a Blue Card with no degree and 5 years of experience. This does not work in Germany, so you must have a university degree.[^11]

**Note:** These requirements will change in November 2023. It will become easier to get a work visa or a Blue Card.

In this guide, I show you how to get a Blue Card.

### Working Holiday Visa

**Citizens of Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Japan between 18 and 30 years old** can apply for a [[Working Holiday Visa]].[^2] The Working Holiday Visa lets you work in Germany for up to 1 year. Working Holiday Visas are easier to get than work visas and Blue Cards. You can apply for the Youth Mobility Visa in Germany, or from your home country.[^39]

### Youth Mobility Visa

**Canadian citizens between 18 and 35 years old** can apply for the [[Youth Mobility Visa]]. The Youth Mobility Visa is similar to the [[Working Holiday Visa]]. It lets you work in Germany for up to a year. You can apply in Canada or in Germany.[^39] Youth Mobility Visas are easier to get than work visas and Blue Cards.

[More information about the Youth Mobility Visa](https://canada.diplo.de/ca-en/consular-services/visa/-/1674826) - German Missions in Canada

### Freelance visa

**Business owners, freelancers and self-employed people** must [apply for the German freelance visa](/guides/how-to-get-a-german-freelance-visa). This is a completely different process.

### Work Visa

**Everyone else** must apply for the work visa. It lets you work as an employee in Germany. In this guide, I show you how to get a work visa.

## German work visa requirements

**Note:** These requirements will change in November 2023. It will become easier to get a work visa or a Blue Card.

- [ ] **You have a job offer in Germany**. It must be a concrete job offer, not just a job listing.[^58]
- [ ] **You have a university degree or a vocational qualification**[^60]  
    Your job must be related to your education. You do not need a university degree to get a German work visa.[^12] Vocational training is enough. Your school does not need to be recognised in [Anabin](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession).
- [ ] **Your employer is in Germany**  
    For example, you can't work for an American company, unless they have an office in Germany.[^12]
- [ ] **You are qualified for the job**[^13]
- [ ] **You are allowed to do this job in Germany**  
    If you need specific qualifications to do your job in Germany, you must prove that you have them.[^61] For example, doctors, engineers and tax advisors need specific qualifications. Use the [recognition finder](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession) to know if your profession requires specific qualifications.
- [ ] **You have approval from the [[ZAV]]**  
    The ZAV verifies that the position can't be filled by a EU citizen. See below for details. If you apply for a Blue Card, and you make over {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year, you don't need this.
- [ ] **You have German health insurance and a place to stay**  
    You must [find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) and [get German health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance) *before* you apply for the work visa.[^40]

You **do not** need to speak German to get a work visa.

If you are under 45 years old, there is no minimum salary requirement. Your salary must be the same as Germans with the same skills.[^33]

If you are over 45 years old, you must:

- Have a [gross income](/glossary/Brutto%20income) above {{ WORK_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur }} per year (in Berlin)[^48]
- **or** have a public or private pension plan that will support you after retirement

## EU Blue Card requirements

The Blue Card has the same requirements as the work visa. It also has these two requirements:

- [ ] **You have a high income**  
    You must make at least {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year (before taxes).[^62] If there is a shortage of skilled workers in your field, you must make at least {{BLUE_CARD_SHORTAGE_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year.[^63] [This list](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1978984/6037342/ISCO-08.pdf) shows which fields have a shortage of skilled workers.
- [ ] **You have a university degree**  
    Your degree must be recognised in Germany. It must be listed as equivalent (*entspricht* or *äquivalent*) in the [Anabin](https://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/hochschulabschluesse.html) database.[^14] In other EU countries, you can get a Blue Card with no degree and 5 years of experience. This does not work in Germany, so you must have a university degree.[^11]

You **do not** need to speak German to get a Blue Card.

## Two ways to apply

There are two ways to apply for the work visa and the Blue Card:

1. **[Apply in Germany](#how-to-apply-in-germany)**  
    Come to Germany, find a job, then apply for a work visa or Blue Card in Germany. You can't work until you have a work visa or Blue Card, but you can look for a job and prepare for your residence permit interview.[^41] It's easier to [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) and [get health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance) if you are already in Germany. You might have to wait a few months without any income. This is riskier and more expensive.
2. **[Apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country)**  
    Apply for a temporary visa at the [German embassy in your country](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/laenderinformationen), come to Germany, then convert your temporary visa to a work visa or Blue Card. You can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany. This is safer and cheaper. It takes around 4 months.[^15]

The best option depends on your citizenship:

- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you can stay in Germany for up to 90 days without a visa.[^16] You can come to Germany, find a job, then apply for a work visa or Blue Card in Germany.[^17] You can also apply in your home country.
- **If you are a citizen of any other country**, there are two ways to get a work visa or Blue Card:
    1. Apply for a work visa or Blue Card at the [German embassy in your country](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/laenderinformationen).
    2. **or** apply for a [Job Seeker Visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) at the [German embassy in your country](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/laenderinformationen),[^18] come to Germany, [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), then apply for a work visa or Blue Card in Germany.

## How to apply in Germany

### Step 1: Come to Germany

- **You need**: a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) (except for citizens of certain countries[^16])
- **You get**: the right to come to Germany and look for work

**If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you can come to Germany without a visa, and apply for a residence permit in Germany.[^19] You can stay for 90 days before you need a residence permit.

**If you are a citizen of any other country**, you might need a [Job Seeker Visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) to enter Germany. The Job Seeker Visa lets you to come to Germany and look for a job.[^16] It's valid for up to 6 months. It does not allow you to work in Germany. After you find a job, you can apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) in Germany. The job. You can't do this with a tourist visa. **If you enter Germany with a tourist visa, your work visa or Blue Card application will be rejected**.[^20]

If you can, [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) before you come to Germany. It's really hard to find an apartment in some cities. It's easier to find an apartment if you already have a job offer. You can also stay in a temporary place: a friend's house, a hotel or a furnished apartment.

### Step 2: [Find a job in Germany](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)

- **You need**: useful skills
- **You get**: a job offer

You need a job offer to apply for a work visa and a Blue Card.[^21] It must be a [skilled job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skilled_worker). You can't get a work visa or Blue Card for unskilled work.[^22] For example, you can't get a work visa to be a cashier or a call centre employee.

If you apply for a Blue Card, your salary must be at least {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year (before taxes). If there is a shortage of skilled workers in your field, your salary must be at least {{BLUE_CARD_SHORTAGE_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year. [This list](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1978984/6037342/ISCO-08.pdf) shows which fields have a shortage of skilled workers.

If you can, [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you come to Germany. When you arrive in Germany, you can focus on other problems.

**[How to find a job in Berlin ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

### Step 3: Get pre-approval from the [[ZAV]] (optional)

- **You need**: a job offer, the pre-approval application form
- **You get**: a letter from the [[ZAV]] that makes your visa application go faster
- **How long it takes**: up to 6 weeks

You might need approval from the [[ZAV]] to get a work visa. There are two ways to get the ZAV approval:

1. **Before you apply for your residence permit**  
    You can get pre-approval from the ZAV before you apply for the work visa. Usually, your employer applies for you.[^25] When you have pre-approval from the ZAV, your visa is approved faster.[^26] It takes around 6 weeks to get the ZAV approval,[^44] and it costs your employer around 400€.[^27] It's not a lot of work for your employer.[^64]
2. **While you apply for your residence permit**  
    If you don't get pre-approval from the ZAV, it will be done when you apply for the work visa.[^45] This is the easiest way, because you don't need to do anything. It takes a little longer to get your work visa this way.

Getting the approval in advance has advantages:

- You can get it while you wait for your work visa appointment.
- It makes the work visa application process smoother. You can find problems with your application *before* your visa appointment. If you have the ZAV approval, you are almost guaranteed to get the work visa.[^64]

You do not need approval from the ZAV if:

- You have a degree from a *German* university, and that degree is related to your job[^42]
- **or** you are applying for the Blue Card[^24] and your salary is over {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year.[^43]
- **or** you are a teacher, scientific assistant, guest scientist, engineer or technician in the research team of a guest scientist[^42]
- **or** you are a teacher at a state school, state-approved private substitute school or a recognised private complementary school[^42]
- **or** you are applying for the [*Bundesfreiwilligendienst*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_volunteers_service)[^23]

### Step 4: [Open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany) (optional)

- **You need**: your passport, a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) (if possible)
- **You get**: a bank account
- **How long it takes**: 1 or 2 days

You don't need a bank account to get a residence permit, but you need it for other things:

- To get paid by your employer
- To pay your rent
- To buy food and other things you need

You don't need to choose a German bank; any bank that supports [SEPA transfers](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung) is okay. [N26](/out/n26) is a good option, because they speak English and don't ask for a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung). I use N26 [since 2016](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26).

**[German banks for expats ➞](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany#german-banks-for-expats)**

You need money in your bank account to pay your apartment deposit (*[[Kaution]]*), and to survive until you get paid. I used [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from another country to my German bank account.

### Step 5: [Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)

- **You need**: a European bank account, money for the *[[Kaution]]*, a job offer (if possible)
- **You get**: a place to live, a *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*

You must find a place to live before your residence permit interview. Start looking for an apartment as soon as possible. [Finding an apartment in Berlin](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) is *really* hard. If you don't speak German, it's even harder.

**[How to find an apartment in Berlin ➞](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**

When you sign a lease, your landlord must give you a *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*. This document confirms that you are allowed to live there. **You can't get a residence permit without this document**.[^28]

- Hotels and Airbnbs will rarely give you a *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*.
- Apartments and rooms that are listed as "no *[[Anmeldung]]* possible" will not give you a *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*.
- You can live at a friend's apartment, but only with the landlord's permission. Without the landlord's permission, you can't get a *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*.

During your residence permit interview, you must prove that you live in Germany. There are two ways to do this:[^12]

- Show your lease and the *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]* you received from your landlord
- **or** show the registration certificate (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*) you get when you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung).

### Step 6: [Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)

- **You need**: a place to live, a *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*
- **You get**: a [registration certificate (*Anmeldebestätigung*)](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung), a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer)
- **How long it takes**: 1 to 4 weeks to get an appointment, 30 minutes to go to your appointment

After you find an apartment, sign a lease and get your *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*, you must [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin). This is called the *[[Anmeldung]]*.

When you register your address, you get a [registration certificate (*Anmeldebestätigung*)](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung). It proves that you officially live at this address. You don't need this for your visa interview, but you might need it to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), [get health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance), get a SIM card etc.

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

2 to 4 weeks after you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) in the mail. Your employer needs it to calculate your [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer). If you don't have a tax ID, they might take more income tax from your salary.[^46]

If you can't register your address, there are [other ways to get a tax ID](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id).

### Step 7: Get health insurance

- **You need**: a German bank account, an *[[Anmeldebestätigung]]* (if possible)
- **You get**: health insurance, a proof of health insurance coverage
- **How long it takes**: 2 to 14 days

You need German health insurance to get a residence permit.[^40]

**[Which health insurance do you need for your German visa? ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**

**[How to choose German health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

Health insurance brokers help you choose the best health insurance for your needs. Their help is free.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

I recommend [Feather Insurance](/out/feather) because I work with them since 2018. I know the founder and the team personally. They helped me switch to private health insurance in 2021. They helped thousands of my readers over the years.

### Step 8: Book your residence permit appointment

- **You need**: nothing
- **You get**: an appointment at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* or German consulate
- **How long it takes**: 15 minutes to a few weeks, depending on your luck

You must get an appointment at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. Do this as soon as you can, because it can take months to get an appointment.[^47]

**[How to get an Ausländerbehörde appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**

If you can't find an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment online, you can [apply by email](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#by-email). [If your current residence permit expires soon](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon), you can usually stay in Germany until you get your new residence permit.

### Step 9: Prepare the required documents

You need a few days to prepare the documents for your work visa application.

**[List of required documents ↓](#required-documents)**

### Step 10: Go to your Ausländerbehörde appointment

- **You need**: all the [required documents](/guides/german-work-visa#required-documents), [health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)
- **You get**: a confirmation letter
- **How long it takes**: less than 1 hour

You go to the *Ausländerbehörde* to give your documents. You will not get your residence permit, just a confirmation letter.

**[What happens at the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

### Step 11: Receive your work visa

- **You need**: your passport
- **You get**: a work visa
- **How long it takes**: 8 to 12 weeks[^29]

**[If your visa application is approved ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-application-is-approved)**

**[If your visa application is rejected ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-application-is-rejected)**

If you apply for a work visa, it's valid for up to 3 years.[^14] If you apply for a Blue Card, it's valid for up to 4 years. If you have a limited work contract, your Blue Card is valid until the end of your contract, plus 3 months.[^50]

### Step 12: Start working in Germany

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working)**

## How to apply in your country

### Step 1: Get your appointment at the German embassy or consulate

Get an appointment at [your local German embassy or consulate](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/aussenpolitik/laenderinformationen). It can be hard to find an appointment. You might only get an appointment 2-3 months later.[^30] Start looking as soon as possible.

### Step 2: Prepare for your visa interview

Before you go to your visa interview, prepare the [required documents](/guides/german-work-visa#required-documents). You also need health insurance and a place to live in Germany.

You need a job offer *before* you go to your visa interview. If you apply for a Blue Card, your salary must be at least {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year (before taxes). If there is a shortage of skilled workers in your field, your salary must be at least {{BLUE_CARD_SHORTAGE_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year. [This list](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/1978984/6037342/ISCO-08.pdf) shows which fields have a shortage of skilled workers.

**[Health insurance for your German visa ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**

### Step 3: Go to your visa interview

You must go to your interview and give your documents. If you have all the required documents, the interview only takes a few minutes.[^49]

### Step 4: Receive your temporary visa

You must go to the embassy or consulate again. They will give you a temporary visa that lets you enter Germany and start working. The temporary visa is [a sticker in your passport](/images/aufenthaltstitel.jpg).

### Step 5: Come to Germany

After you get your temporary visa, you can [travel to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin).

If you have a work visa, you can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany. You will need to [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), [get a tax ID](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id), [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), [get health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance) and a few other things. You can find an apartment, open a bank account and get health insurance before you arrive in Germany. It will save you some time.

### Step 5: Start working in Germany

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working)**

### Step 6: Convert your temporary visa to a residence permit

Your temporary visa is valid for 6 to 12 months.[^36] You must go to the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* and convert your temporary visa to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* can ask to see your pay slips during your appointment.

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**. If you apply elsewhere, the required documents can be different. Check the website of the *Ausländerbehörde*, embassy or consulate where you apply.

The interviewer will scan your documents page by page. Do not staple the pages together. If possible, print everything on A4 paper.

    Your passport must...[^51]
    - ...be valid for another 6 months
    - ...be issued in the last 10 years
    - ...show your signature

    Bring the original, not a copy.[^12]
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance coverage in Germany**  
    - [ ] **Mitgliedsbescheinigung**  
        You can get this document from your health insurance company.[^53] If you have public health insurance, look for a *Mitgliedsbescheinigung nach 175 SGB V*. You can get a similar document for private health insurance.
    - [ ] **Health insurance card**, if you have one.
    - [ ] **Proof of health insurance payments**
