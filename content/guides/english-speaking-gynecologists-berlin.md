When it comes to your health, it's important to have a doctor who speaks your language. The gynaecologists and obstetricians below were recommended by the expat community because they speak English. [Doctolib](https://www.doctolib.de/) and [Doctena](https://www.doctena.de/en/) also let you search for doctors by language.
