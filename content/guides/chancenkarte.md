- **[[Working Holiday Visa]]** and **[[Youth Mobility Visa]]**  
    For young people from certain countries. Work in Germany for 1 year. No salary requirement. No education needed.
- **[[Job seeker visa]]**  
    For looking for work in Germany. It gives you 6 to 18 months to [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). To start working, you need a work visa or a Blue Card. The opportunity card is usually a better option.
