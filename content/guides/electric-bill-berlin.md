This guide explains how you pay for heating, hot water and electricity in Germany.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## One home, two bills

In Germany, you get 2 power bills

- The utilities (*Nebenkosten*) that are included in your [warm rent](/glossary/Warmmiete)
- The electric bill from your electricity company

### The Nebenkosten

Your [warm rent](/glossary/Warmmiete) includes the *estimated* cost of utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*). Heating and hot water are usually included with your rent.

Every year, your landlord calculates how much water and energy you really used, and sends you a bill (*[[Nebenkostenabrechnung]]*). If you paid too much *Nebenkosten*, you get money back. If you did not pay enough, you get an invoice.

If your apartment has a [tankless water heater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankless_water_heating) (*Durchlauferhitzer*), hot water is not included in your rent.[^3] Your *Nebenkosten* and warm rent are lower, but your electric bills are higher.

### The electric bill

Your rent does not include the electricity for lights and appliances.

When you [move in](/guides/moving-in), you must sign a contract with an electricity company. They don't need to connect anything. They just start charging you after you give them your [meter reading](/glossary/Zählerstand).

Every month, you pay for your *estimated* electricity use. Every year, the electricity company asks for your electricity meter reading (*[[Zählerstand]]*). This tells them how much electricity you really used. If you paid too much, you get money back. If you did not pay enough, you get an invoice.

## How much are the Nebenkosten?

The warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*) includes heating, water, garbage disposal and many other things. It's usually 50€ to 200€ a month. It can be higher if your building has a garden, a gym or other facilities.

## How much is the electric bill?

Use [Verivox](/out/verivox-electricity) or [Check24](/out/check24-electricity) to estimate real electricity costs.

The cost depends on how much electricity you use. Estimate 1,500 to 2,000 kWh per person.[^1] If your rent does not include hot water, you will use a little more electricity.

Electricity companies charge a base price, plus a fee per kWh. For example, you might pay 10€ per month, plus 0.35€ per kWh:

> Base price: 10€ per month
> Electricity usage: 0.35€ × 125 kWh = 43.75€
> Total: 53.75€ per month

## How to save money

- **[Switch to another electricity company](/guides/saving-money-germany#change-electricity-and-gas-providers-every-year)** every 1 or 2 years.[^2] You get a special price for 1 or 2 years. When the special price ends, switch to another company. Add a reminder in your calendar. [Verivox](/out/verivox-electricity) automates the switch; you don't have to do anything.
- **Compare prices** with [Verivox](/out/verivox-electricity) or [Check24](/out/check24-electricity)
