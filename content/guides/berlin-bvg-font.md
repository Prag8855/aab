The BVG uses the [FF Transit](https://www.fontshop.com/families/ff-transit) font for all its signage and advertising. This font and its pictograms were designed by Berlin-based design firm [MetaDesign](http://en.metadesign.com/) in 1997. FF Transit was purposefully designed for signage, and is also used by the Düsseldorf airport and the [Société de transport de Montréal](http://www.stm.info/en/press/press-releases/2015/the-stm-rolls-out-new-signage-in-metro-stations).
