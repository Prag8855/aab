## Before you start

### Are you really a freelancer?

Some employers hire employees, but treat them like freelancers. This is called fake self-employment or pseudo self-employment (*[[Scheinselbstständigkeit]]*). It's illegal.[^0]

Generally, you are not self-employed if...

- You only have one client for a long time.
- You are integrated in your client's business. You have a company email, company business cards, a uniform, etc.
- You always work at the same location. You can't choose where you work.
- You have a fixed salary.
- You do not use your own equipment.

Fake self-employment is a bad deal. You have no job security. You get no paid [sick leave](/guides/sick-leave), no public pension and no unemployment benefits. You will not get a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) for fake self-employment.

**[What is fake self-employment? ➞](https://redtapetranslation.com/do-i-need-to-be-worried-about-scheinselbststandigkeit/)**

### Do you speak German?

You don't need to speak German to start a business, but it really helps.

Many forms, letters, websites and services are only in German. You can't always solve problems in English. You will need help to write emails, make phone calls or go to appointments. It makes everything harder.

If you need a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) to live in Germany, you need clients in Germany. You can't get a freelance visa without German clients. It's harder to find German clients if you don't speak German.

### Taxes and cost of living

Understand the [cost of moving to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin#save-money), the [cost of living](/guides/cost-of-living), and the [cost of running a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#cost-of-running-a-business). This helps you decide how much savings you need, and [how much to charge your clients](#set-your-prices).

{% include '_blocks/taxCalculator.html' %}

If you need a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) to live in Germany, you must have a few thousand euros in your bank account. It takes [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to get a freelance visa. Usually, while you wait, you can't work, so you have no income. It's cheaper if you apply for the freelance visa in your home country, and move to Germany once you can start working.

## Move to Germany

### Find a place to live

It's hard to find your first apartment in Berlin. It's *much* harder if you are self-employed. Your only options might be a [[WG]] or a temporary furnished apartment. Find an apartment where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). It's [really important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address).

**[How to find an apartment ➞](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**

### Get health insurance

In Germany, you *must* have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). It's a big part of your [cost of living](/guides/cost-of-living).

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

As a freelancer, **never choose health insurance yourself**. It's a terrible idea. Freelancers often get stuck with bad or expensive health insurance. [Freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) applications are often rejected because of invalid health insurance.

Talk with a health insurance broker. They will help you choose the best insurance. It's completely free.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

I usually recommend [Feather Insurance](/out/feather). I work with them since 2018. They helped me switch to private insurance and save over 400€ *per month*. I had a difficult case, and Rob worked for months to get me accepted. They have a lot of experience with immigrants.

**[How to choose health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

**[Health insurance for the freelance visa ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)**

If you can, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]*. They pay half of your health insurance. It's a really good deal. You can do this later.

### Get a residence permit

If you are not a citizen of the EU, the [[EEA]] or Switzerland, you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live in Germany. The freelance visa is a residence permit for self-employed people.

It takes [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to get a freelance visa.[^8] Usually, while you wait, you can't work. You need enough savings to live a few months without an income.

Your current residence permit [might allow self-employment](/guides/residence-permit#for-self-employment). This lets you start your business while you wait for your freelance visa.

**[How to apply for a freelance visa ➞](/guides/freelance-visa)**

## Start your business

**[How to start a business ➞](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**

### Set your prices

You must decide how much you will charge your clients.

As a freelancer, you get no [paid vacations](/guides/vacation-days), [holidays](/guides/public-holidays) or [sick days](/guides/sick-leave). If you don't work, you don't get paid. You only work around 210 days per year, excluding weekends, holidays and vacation days.[^1] You also do a lot of unpaid work like accounting, marketing, paperwork and maintenance.

You must also pay for your taxes, health insurance and your retirement. That's up to half of your income. You must also pay for your tools and office space.

This is why you must **charge more than employees**. Take the hourly rate you would make as an employee, and double it.[^5] This is not a reliable rule, but it's a good start.

**[Income survey for solo freelancers ➞](https://www.so-los.de/material/SO_LOS-Ergebnisse.pdf)**{{ fail_on('2026-01-01') }}

Usually, you charge higher prices for short contracts. Longer contracts are more stable, and have less overhead. You spend less time finding clients, interviewing and writing contracts. In some industries, you charge clients per day, not per hour.[^3] If you get this wrong, it can look unprofessional.

[If you charge VAT](/guides/value-added-tax), you must usually include it in your prices. [[B2C]] clients expect [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) to be included in the price. [[B2B]] clients expect VAT to be excluded.[^11]

Ask freelancers in your field how they work. Some industries organise [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/) and presentations for freelancers. It's a good place to learn how the industry works.

**[Where to ask business questions ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#business-questions)**

### Find clients

When you apply for a freelance visa, you must prove that your business will work. You must approach German companies and get them to sign [letters of intent](/glossary/Absichtserkl%C3%A4rung). This is not a contract, just a letter that says they are interested in hiring you. You need at least two letters of intent for your visa application.

**[How to get letters of intent ➞](/guides/freelance-visa-letter-of-intent)**

There are many ways to find clients. It depends on your industry. Try networking meetups, Facebook groups, and other communities in your industry.

### Register your business

You must register your business with the *[[Finanzamt]]*. This is how you get a *[[Steuernummer]]* and a [VAT number](/glossary/Umsatzsteuernummer). You must put those numbers on your invoices. It takes a few hours of work, and around 4 weeks of waiting.

You can start working before you finish the *Finanzamt* registration.[^1]

**[How to register your business at the Finanzamt ➞](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung)**

### Get a trade licence

In Germany, there are two types of self-employment: as a *[[Freiberufler]]*, or as a *[[Gewerbe]]*. [Learn the difference](/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe). If your business is a *[[Gewerbe]]*, you must also [get a trade licence](/guides/gewerbeschein).

A tax advisor (*[[Steuerberater]]*) can register the business for you. You can also use [Sorted](/out/sorted-fragebogen) to do it in English, for free.

You can start working before you get your *Gewerbeschein*.[^4]

**[How to start a business in Germany ➞](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**

### Accounting

Every year, you must make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). This tells the *[[Finanzamt]]* how much money you made, and how much [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) you must pay.

You will probably need to charge [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) on your invoices. If you charge VAT, you must make monthly, quarterly or yearly [VAT declarations](/glossary/Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung), depending on your income.

There are many ways to do tax and VAT declarations:

- Hire a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater)
- Use [accounting software](/guides/german-tax-software)
- Use a business bank with accounting features
- Do this yourself in [[ELSTER]]

Use a tax advisor until you understand the system better. Tax advisors are expensive. If you have a simple business, you can use accounting software instead. I use [LexOffice](/out/lexoffice), but it's only in German.

You need a tax advisor to [renew your freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa). They must prepare some of the required documents for you.

## After you start

### Get legal insurance

Legal insurance (*[[Rechtsschutzversicherung]]*) covers your legal costs if you need a lawyer. It's useful when you have a problem with a client or another business.

You must get professional legal insurance. Private legal insurance rarely covers business activities.

**[What does legal insurance cover? ➞](/guides/legal-insurance)**

[Feather](/out/feather-rechtsschutz) and [Getsafe](/out/getsafe-rechtsschutz) sell legal insurance, and they speak English. [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-rechtsschutz) helps you compare insurances, but it's only in German.

### Get disability insurance

If you are an employee, you get sickness pay while you are sick. Your employer pays your full salary for the first 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, your health insurance pays you 70% of your salary (up to {{GKV_KRANKENGELD_DAILY_LIMIT|cur}}€ per day) for 78 weeks.

By default, freelancers don't get sickness pay. If you don't work, you don't get paid.

If you pay a little more for health insurance, you get sickness pay for 78 weeks.

You can also get disability insurance (*[[Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung]]*). It gives you a regular income if you are too sick to work. Disability insurance is optional, but it's useful if you have dependents or a mortgage. Around 26% of Germans have disability insurance.[^2] It costs around 40€ per month.[^9]

If you don't speak German, [Feather](/out/feather-disability) and [Getsafe](/out/getsafe-berufunfahigkeit) sell disability insurance, and they speak English. [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-berufunfahigkeit) helps you compare options, but it's only in German.

**[Types of insurance in Germany ➞](/guides/insurance)**

### Save for retirement

Employees automatically save for a retirement, but freelancers don't. You must plan for retirement and set money aside.

There is no easy way to do this, especially for immigrants. You might need a flexible pension, in case you want to cash out sooner, become an employee, or leave Germany.

A financial advisor can help you choose a pension. Usually, they are paid by commission. In my experience, many of them are not honest. Seamus at [Horizon65](/out/horizon65) is the only financial advisor I trust.

### Join the [[Künstlersozialkasse]]

If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher, you can apply for the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* after you get your freelance visa. They will pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung). It's a really good deal.

**[How to apply for the Künstlersozialkasse ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

### Join VG Wort

If you publish texts or run a website, you should also join [VG Wort](https://www.feiyr.com/en/faq/264/,What-does-the-VG-Wort-do.html). You can earn a few thousand euros per year from your published texts.
