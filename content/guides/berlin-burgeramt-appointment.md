## Book an appointment online

Choose a service in [the list of services](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistungen/), and click "*Termin berlinweit suchen*".

![Berlin.de Termin buchen](/images/berlin-de-termin-buchen.png "Click this button to find an appointment anywhere in Berlin")

**If there are no appointments**, try again every few minutes. Most new appointments appear during working hours. There are more appointments in the morning, between 8:00 and 11:00.[^0] Look for appointments everywhere in Berlin, not just near you.

The Bürgeramt does not release all available appointments online. Some appointments are only for people who call 115. Other appointments are only given by Bürgeramt employees.[^1]

### Use my appointment finder

To [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung), use my [*Anmeldung* appointment finder](/tools/appointment-finder).

## Call 115

Call [115](tel:+4930115) between 7:00 and 18:00.[^2] This is the *[[Bürgertelefon]]*. They can find you a *Bürgeramt* appointment, even when there are no appointments online.[^1]

They only speak German. You must wait a few minutes to talk to someone.

## Email the Bürgeramt

Email your local *Bürgeramt*, explain what you need, and ask for an appointment. If your situation is urgent, include a proof. You might get an appointment faster, even if there are no appointments online.[^3] They usually reply in 1 or 2 days.

## Go to the Bürgeramt in person

If your situation is urgent, you can go to the *Bürgeramt* in person. They will help you on the same day, or give you an emergency appointment. For example, if you need documents to travel soon, you can go in person.[^5]

If your situation is not urgent, ask for an appointment by email. It's faster.[^4]

## Pay someone to go for you

Relocation consultants can book the appointment for you, and go to the *Bürgeramt* with you. If you don't speak German, this is a good idea. [Red Tape Translation](https://redtapetranslation.com/translation-services/take-a-translator-all-about-berlin/) and [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) offer this service.

## More tips

### Pick any Bürgeramt

You can go to any *Bürgeramt* in Berlin, not just the one near you. The ones in central neighbourhoods are busier.[^1] You can't go to a *Bürgeramt* in [[Brandenburg]].

### Use online services

You can do some things online, and avoid a Bürgeramt visit. For example, you can [deregister your address](/guides/abmeldung-deregister-in-berlin) ([*A<u>b</u>meldung*](/glossary/Abmeldung)) by email or by post.

### Multiple services in one appointment

You can do multiple things in one appointment:

1. Select a *Bürgeramt* in [this list](https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/)
2. Select multiple services from the list
3. Click "*An diesem Standort einen Termin buchen*".
