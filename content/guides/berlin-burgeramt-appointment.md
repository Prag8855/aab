If you must go to the *[[Bürgeramt]]* in Berlin, you must have an appointment. This guide shows you how to find an appointment, and what to do if there are no appointments available.

## Avoid it

You don't always need to visit the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. You can do certain things online, or by mail. For example, you can [deregister your address](/guides/abmeldung-deregister-in-berlin) ([*A<u>b</u>meldung*](/glossary/Abmeldung)) by email or by mail.

## Book an appointment online

Select a service from [the list of services](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistungen/), and click "*Termin berlinweit suchen*" to look for appointments in all *Bürgeramt* locations.

You can also use the [*Anmeldung* appointment finder](/tools/appointment-finder) to find *[[Anmeldung]]* appointments faster.

**Sometimes, there are no appointments**. This is normal. Refresh the page every few minutes, and you will find an appointment. New appointments appear [randomly](https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/berlin-buergeramt-experiment) during the day. There are more appointments during working hours. You don't need to check early in the morning[^0]. You won't find more appointments at 7AM than at 10AM.

You should look for appointments in all *Bürgeramt* locations, not just the nearest one.

1. Select a *Bürgeramt* in [this list](https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/)
2. Select multiple services from the list
3. Click "*An diesem Standort einen Termin buchen*".

## Call 115

Call [030 115](tel:+4930115). This is the *[[Bürgertelefon]]*. You can ask about the *Bürgeramt* services, and ask for a *Bürgeramt* appointment. This phone line is also available in some other German cities.

They only speak German. You must wait a few minutes to talk to someone.

**You will not get an appointment faster with this phone number**. They have the same appointments as online.

## Go without an appointment

Do not go to the *Bürgeramt* without an appointment. **This is not possible in 2023**. You can't go to the *Bürgeramt* without an appointment.

## Try other Bürgeramt locations

You do not need to go to the nearest *Bürgeramt*. You can go to any location in Berlin. However, you can't go to a *Bürgeramt* in [[Brandenburg]].

## Pay someone to do it

Relocation consultants can book the appointment for you, and go to the *Bürgeramt* with you. If you don't speak German, this is a good idea. [Red Tape Translation](https://www.redtapetranslation.com/services/take-a-translator-aab/) and [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) offer this service.
