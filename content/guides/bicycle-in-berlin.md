Berlin is better on a bicycle. The city is very flat, and it has a big network of bike paths. In the summer, it's the best way to get around.

In this guide, I show you how to buy a bike, what rules you must follow, and how to deal with bicycle theft.

## Where to buy a bicycle in Berlin

### Buying a new bicycle

There are also many small, **independent bicycle shops**. They can give you personalised advice. For example, they can find a bike that fits your body, customise a bike for your needs, or even build a bicycle just for you. When you have problems with your bicycle, they can help you.

There are also big bicycle stores like 

- [**Decathlon**](https://www.decathlon.de/) (many locations in Berlin)  
    Big sport equipment store. The main store is near Alexanderplatz. They sell cheap, medium quality bicycles.
- [**Stadler**](https://shop.zweirad-stadler.de/) (Charlottenburg, Prenzlauer Berg)  
    Giant bicycle store. They have two locations in Berlin.

### Buying a used bicycle

Used bicycles are cheaper. There are many places where you can buy them:

- **[Berliner Fahrradmarkt](http://berlinerfahrradmarkt.de/fahrraeder/fahrrad-kaufen)** (Moabit, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg)  
    Monthly bicycle markets with hundreds of bicycles. There is also a bicycle workshop.
- **[Fietsenbörse](https://fietsenboerse.de/)** (Schöneberg)  
    Monthly bicycle market with hundreds of bicycles.
- **[eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/s-fahrraeder/c217)**  
    Classified ads website. Many bikes are listed there.
- **[Flea markets](https://www.berlin.de/special/shopping/flohmaerkte/)**  
    There are flea markets every Sunday in Berlin. Many of them sell bicycles. Do not buy a bicycle there. The bicycles are too old, too expensive, and often stolen.
- **[Sell Your Bike Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/groups/sellyourbikeberlin/)**  
    Facebook group with over 30 000 members. If you speak French, there is also [Les vélos de Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/groups/lesvelosdeberlin/). Watch for [stolen bicycles](#buying-a-stolen-bicycle).
- **Bicycle auctions**  
    There are regular auctions for [lost and found](/guides/lost-and-found-berlin) items:
    - [City of Berlin auctions](https://www.luedtke-versteigerungen.de/fahrradversteigerung)
    - [Toll office auctions](https://www.zoll-auktion.de/auktion/kategorie/Fahrr%C3%A4der_Zubeh%C3%B6r/1103)

The quality of used bicycles varies a lot. Always try the bike before you buy it. Check if the brakes work, the gears change smoothly, the frame is not cracked, the wheels are straight, etc. [This guide](https://bikefair.org/blog/how-to-choose-a-second-hand-bike#:~:text=check%20the%20bike) can help you.

### Buying a stolen bicycle

Many used bicycles are stolen. Before you buy a used bicycle, [find its frame number](https://www.krist.com/glossar/rahmennummer---wo-ist-die-nur__61.php) (*Rahmennummer*) or registration tag (*Fahrradkennzeichen*), and enter it in [this database](https://www.rahmennummern-check.de/), [this database](https://bikefinder.de/diebstahldatenbank/) and [this database](https://fahrradnummer.de/).

Sign a sales contract (*Kaufvertrag*) like [this one](https://www.adfc.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Im-Alltag/Fahrradkauf/Download/ADFC_Musterkaufvertrag_2018-08.pdf). If the bike is stolen, the seller usually refuses to sign a contract.[^1]

If you are caught with a stolen bicycle, the police will seize it. If you can find the seller, you can get your money back. If not, you lose your money and your bicycle.

### Renting a bicycle

If you only stay in Berlin for a few months, you can rent a bicycle instead.

- **[Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.de/)**  
    Rent a bicycle for a few months. Minimum 20€ per month. Maintenance and repairs are included in the price. They also rent electric bikes.
- **[Recyclies](https://recyclies.com/)**  
    Recycled and refurbished bicycles. Cheaper than Swapfiets, with more flexible contracts. Maintenance and repairs are included in the price.
- **[Bikesurf](https://www.bikesurf.org/)**  
    Borrow a bike, pay what you can.
- **Bike sharing**  
    Some bike sharing services let you rent a bike for less than a day, only when you need it.
    - [Call a Bike](https://www.callabike.de/en/cities-berlin/) - The [[Deutsche Bahn]]'s bike sharing service - formerly LIDL-Bike
    - [Nextbike](https://www.nextbike.de/en/)
    - [Jelbi](https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/) - Rent bikes from different bike sharing services
    - [Lime](https://www.li.me/locations) - Bicycles with electric assist
    - [Donkey Republic](https://www.donkey.bike/cities/bike-rental-berlin/)
    - [Avocargo](https://www.avocargo.one/) - Electric cargo bikes
    - [fLotte](https://flotte-berlin.de/) - Cargo bikes
    
### Bicycles for refugees

If you are a refugee, you can get a free bicycle from [Rückenwind](https://rueckenwind.berlin/english/) or [Frieda](https://www.instagram.com/bicycle_repair_diy_berlin/).

### How to save money

- **Tax deductions**  
    Bicycles, bicycle maintenance and [bike theft insurance](#bike-theft-insurance) are all [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^2] Save your receipts for your next [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung).
- **Help from your employer**  
    Some employers pay for your bicycle, or for a bicycle rental service. You can get a free bicycle, or a big rebate on your bicycle purchase.
- **Therapy bike**  
    If you need a special bicycle for your therapy, your health insurer must pay for it.[^3]
- **Buy a used bike**  
    Old bicycles are reliable and easy to maintain. You don't need a new bicycle, even if you know nothing about bicycle repair. Used bicycles are much cheaper than new ones.

## Bicycle repairs and maintenance

### Bicycle repair shops

There are many [bike repair shops](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Fahrradwerkstatt/) (*Fahrradwerkstatt*) in every neighbourhood. There are good ones and bad ones. Check online reviews before choosing one.

### Self-service workshops

If you want to repair your bicycle yourself, there are many self-service repair stations (*Selbsthilfewerkstatt*) in Berlin. Many of them have friendly people who can teach you how to repair your bike.

- [ADFC bicycle workshop](https://berlin.adfc.de/artikel/die-fahrrad-selbsthilfe-werkstatt-shw-des-adfc-berlin) (Kreuzberg)
- [Berliner Fahrradmarkt](http://berlinerfahrradmarkt.de/) (Moabit, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg) - bicycle market with repair station
- [FUrad](https://www.facebook.com/FUradFU/) - bike workshop by FU Berlin
- [Hubschrauber](https://www.refrat.de/hubschrauber/) (Mitte) - bike workshop by Humbolt University

If you just need air in your tires, use the [map of public bicycle pumps](https://www.pumpsofberlin.com/#13/52.5221/13.4131), or [buy a bicycle pump](https://www.decathlon.de/browse/c0-alle-sportarten-a-z/c1-fahrrad-welt/c4-fahrrad-luftpumpen-zubehor/_/N-rrj9o) for less than 10€.

## Bicycle theft

Bike theft is very common in Berlin. Over 30,000 bicycles are stolen every year.[^4] Always lock your bike with a strong [bicycle lock](https://www.amazon.de/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&k=&ref=nb_sb_noss&rh=n:4237036031&url=node=4237036031&linkCode=sl2&tag=nicolasboulia-21&linkId=e4fe756eeabc1341695527b071e79a0b&language=de_DE) (*Fahrradschloß*). Do not leave your bike locked on the street or at a train station overnight. If possible, lock your bike in a private area like a courtyard or a cellar. Always lock the bike to something else, so that thieves don't carry it away.

### Bicycle registration

The Berlin police can [label your bike](https://www.berlin.de/polizei/aufgaben/praevention/diebstahl-und-einbruch/artikel.358680.php), and register it in their database. If your bike is stolen, it will be harder to resell. If the police finds your bike, they can return it to you. This is is a free service. You can find bicycle registration events [here](https://www.berlin.de/land/kalender/?c=63).

You should also write down your bicycle's frame number (*Rahmennummer*). If your bicycle is stolen, you can use this number to report the theft. [This page](https://www.krist.com/glossar/rahmennummer---wo-ist-die-nur__61.php) shows you how to find your *Rahmennummer*.

### Bike theft insurance

If you have an expensive bike, you can get household insurance *[[Hausratversicherung]]* that covers bike theft, or just bicycle insurance (*[[Fahrradversicherung]]*. If your bike is stolen, your insurance will pay to replace it. Bicycle insurance only covers recent bicycles. Older bicycles are not covered. If you don't speak German, [Feather](/out/feather-bicycle) and [GetSafe](/out/getsafe-bicycle) offer bicycle insurance in English.

### What to do if your bike gets stolen

Report the theft to the Berlin police. You can do it online. If your bicycle is found again, they will let you know. You can also look at [this list of recovered bicycles](https://www.berlin.de/polizei/service/vermissen-sie-ihr-fahrrad/).

## Bicycle requirements in Berlin

Your bicycle must have lights, reflectors, a bell and working brakes. The Berlin Police sometimes controls bicycles.

If you don't have a bell, you can get a 15€ fine.
- **Brakes** (*Bremse*)  
    Your bicycle must have working brakes.[^11] The front and rear breaks must both work.[^12] If your brakes don't work, you can get a 10€ fine.[^13]

Some equipment is not required, and some equipment is forbidden:

- **Helmet**  
    You can ride without a helmet in Germany.
- **Lock**  
    In Berlin, you should get a strong lock for your bike. Bike theft is very common.
- **Panniers and bags**  
    Panniers and bags are allowed. They are very useful in Berlin.
- **Turn signals**  
    Turn signals are only allowed for multiple track (3 or 4-wheeled) bicycles.[^14]
- **Action cameras and dashcams**  
    You can use an action camera on your bicycle.[^14] You must still follow [German photography laws](/guides/photography-laws-germany).

## Road rules for cyclists in Germany

These are some of the most important road rules for cyclists. Those rules apply for all of Germany, not just Berlin. If you break the law on a bicycle, you can lose points on your driving licence.[^15]

- **You can't ride on the sidewalk.**[^16]  
    You must ride your bicycle on the street, not on the sidewalk. If you ride on the sidewalk, you can get a 55€ fine.[^17] Children up to 8 years old *must* ride on the sidewalk. Children up to 10 years old *can* ride on the sidewalk. Parents who accompany their children can also ride on the sidewalk. Pedestrians still have priority on the sidewalk.
- **You must use bicycle paths with blue signs.**[^18]  
    If you see [these blue signs](/images/bicycle-path-signs-stvo-237-240-241.jpg), you *must* use the bicycle path. You can't ride on the street. If you ignore those signs, you can get a 20€ fine.[^19] If you don't see any blue signs, you can also ride on the street. If you see [this sign](/images/fahrraeder-frei-schild.png), you can ride there, but you don't have priority. If you ride in the wrong direction, you can still get a 20€ fine.[^20]
- **You must use hand signals before you turn.**[^21]  
    Before you turn left or right, you must announce it with hand signals. If you don't use hand signals, you can get a 10 to 35€ fine.[^20] Point left with your left hand, and point right with your right hand.[^22]
- **You can ride next to your friend if you don't block traffic.**[^23]  
    You can ride [two abreast](/images/cyclists-two-abreast.jpg) if it does not block traffic. Otherwise, you must ride [one behind the other](/images/cyclists-file-queue-line.jpg). If you ride two abreast and block traffic, you can get a 20€ fine.[^19]
- **You must give bus and tram passengers the priority.**[^24]  
    If you ride past a stopped bus or tram, you must slow down. You do not have priority. The passengers who enter and exit the bus have priority. In [this photo](/images/bus-pedestrian-bicycle-priority.jpg), the bicycle must wait for people to enter/leave the bus.
- **You can't ride in the bus lane**[^25]  
    You can't use the bus lanes, unless there is a ["Fahrrad frei" sign](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Zusatzzeichen_1022-10_-_Radfahrer_frei%2C_StVO_1992.svg/200px-Zusatzzeichen_1022-10_-_Radfahrer_frei%2C_StVO_1992.svg.png). If you ride on a bus lane, you can get a 15€ fine.[^26]
- **You must stop at red lights.**  
    Cyclists can't cross the street on a red light, just like in a car. If you cross on a red light, you can get a 90€ fine, and lose one Flensburg point.[^27] You can't turn right when the light is red, unless you see [this sign](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Zeichen_721_-_Gr%C3%BCnpfeilschild_mit_Beschr%C3%A4nkung_auf_den_Radverkehr%2C_StVO_2020.svg/450px-Zeichen_721_-_Gr%C3%BCnpfeilschild_mit_Beschr%C3%A4nkung_auf_den_Radverkehr%2C_StVO_2020.svg.png).[^28]
- **You can't use your phone while riding.**  
    If you use your phone while riding, you can get a 55€ fine.[^19]
- **You can use headphones while riding.**  
    You can listen to music on your bicycle, but it must not be too loud.[^29] You must be able to hear sirens and horns.[^30] You can also make hands-free phone calls.[^31] If you get in an accident, and you wear headphones, you might not get money from the insurance company.[^32] They can say that you are partly responsible for the accident, even if you were the victim.
- **You must hold the handlebars.**  
    If you ride without hands, you can get a 5€ fine.[^20]
- **You can't ride your bicycle in some parks.**  
    Look at the signs near park entrances. Sometimes, bicycles are forbidden. If you ride your bicycle in these parks, you can get a 15€ fine.

### Right of way

If you ride a bicycle in Germany, you must understand who has the right of way. [This website](https://routetogermany.com/drivingingermany/right-of-way) explains it really well.
