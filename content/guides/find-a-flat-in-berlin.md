## Is it hard to find an apartment?

**Yes, it's really hard**. It can take months and hundreds of applications.[^0] It's one of the hardest parts of [moving to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin). You might need to live in temporary places until you find a home.

If you are not in Berlin yet, it's almost impossible. Get [short-term housing](#short-term-housing), move to Berlin, then look for a better place.

**[Your housing options ↓](#your-housing-options)**

## Before you start

Before you [look for apartments](#look-for-apartments), you must...

- [ ] **Know [your options](#your-housing-options)**  
    Recent immigrants have fewer options. Don't waste time on apartments that you can't get.
- [ ] **Save money**  
    You need enough for the rent, the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution), and some furniture and house supplies. If you have a low budget, rent a room in a [[WG]].
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**  
    Pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung), or send money from another country with [Wise](/out/transferwise).
- [ ] **Understand [how housing works](#important-knowledge)**
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**

## 1. Look for apartments

### Apartment search websites

- **[ImmoScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)** ⭐️  
    The biggest housing website. It's very competitive. Without the premium account, it's much harder to find an apartment.[^1] Create a detailed profile to improve your chances.[^27]
- **[Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/)** ⭐️ - Biggest classified ads website.
- **[Immowelt](https://www.immowelt.de/)** - Second biggest housing website

### People you know

- **Tell everyone you know**  
    Your friends, family, colleagues or classmates might know someone who has a place to rent. People often find an apartment through their connections.[^21] They can also host you for a few weeks, and give you a way to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). Your religious community might also help.[^50]
- **Ask your [[Hausverwaltung]]**  
    They might give you another apartment, or put you on a waiting list.
- **Get help from your university**  
    They have help clinics and a board with apartment listings.[^7] Join the waiting list for [student housing](#student-housing).

### Real estate agents

An agent (*[[Makler]]*) can help you find an apartment. Some are really good, and some are useless. They are hard to find.[^23] Their maximum fee is 2 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete), plus [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer). Don't pay an agent fee if you did not hire the agent.

- **[BerlinRelo](https://www.berlinrelo.de/)** ⭐️  
    Long-term apartments only. Graham is really good at his job. He accepts a small number of customers, and guarantees results.
- **[Get The Flat](https://gettheflat.com/)**  
    They help you prepare your documents and apply for apartments. They use bots to find apartments and automatically write to landlords.
- **[Move to Berlin Relocation](https://www.moveto-berlin.com/en/home-search-2/)**  
    Short-term and long-term apartments. They help you prepare your documents and apply for apartments.
- [Nerea Lopez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nerea-lopez-berlin/)
- [HomeSK](https://www.homesk.de/Search) - Only furnished apartments. Very expensive.

### Bots and automation

To get an apartment, you must be fast. Use tools to find apartments and message landlords first.

- **Apartment bots**  
    Use the [Hypofriend apartment bot](https://hypofriend.de/en/lp/immofriend), [@berlinflatsbot](https://t.me/berlinflatsbot), [Flathunters](https://flathunter.codders.io/), [immonotify](https://immonotify.com/) and [Homeboy](https://www.homeboy.immo/en). You get a notification when there are new apartments.
- **Alerts and push notifications**  
    Install the [Kleinanzeigen](https://themen.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/mobile-apps/) and [ImmoScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/mobile-services/) apps, and create alerts for new apartment listings.[^44] Turn on push notifications for the [Facebook groups](#facebook-groups) that you follow.

### Newspapers

Some landlords still buy apartment ads in the newspaper. You can find apartments that are not listed anywhere else.[^33]

## 2. Choose apartments to visit

In Berlin, **you can't be picky**, but you can still avoid [scams](/guides/housing-scams) and bad apartments.

### Apartment checklist

- [ ] **[Is it a scam?](/guides/housing-scams)**
- [ ] **Is the price fair?**  
    The [ImmoScout24 rent atlas](https://atlas.immobilienscout24.de/) shows rent prices in the area. Furnished apartments are much more expensive. If you can't afford the rent, the [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde) can reject your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.[^2] If the price is too low, it might be a scam.
- [ ] **Can you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) there?**  
    Choose an apartment where you can do your *[[Anmeldung]]*. [It's very important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address) for recent immigrants.
- [ ] **Is the lease unlimited?**  
    Look for an unlimited (*unbefristet*) contract. A short-term lease means that you must move again in a few months. [Short-term leases are often illegal](/guides/housing-scams#short-term-leases).
- [ ] **What is included?**  
    Most apartments come empty. No furniture, appliances, curtains or light fixtures. [[WG]]s might come with most of what you need. Furnished apartments come with everything, but they are expensive.
    - **Electricity**  
        Is hot water included in your warm rent? If the building has central water heating, it's usually included in your *[[Nebenkosten]]*. If the apartment has a [tankless water heater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankless_water_heating) (*Durchlauferhitzer*), hot water is not included.[^3] Your *Nebenkosten* are lower, but your electric bills are higher.
    - **Kitchen**  
        Is the kitchen (counter, sink, stove, fridge) included? Apartments *mit [[Einbauküche]]* include a kitchen. Sometimes, you must buy the kitchen from the previous tenant at a ridiculous price. [It's a common scam.](/guides/housing-scams#buy-the-furniture-to-get-the-flat)
- [ ] **How is the housing company?**  
    Search for reviews of your landlord or housing company (*[[Hausverwaltung]]*). It could be a really bad landlord or a [housing scam](/guides/housing-scams).
- [ ] **Neubau or Altbau?**  
    New buildings (*Neubau*) are usually quieter and better insulated. They have concrete walls and floors. Old buildings (*Altbau*) have beautiful high ceilings and hardwood floors, but they're usually louder and more expensive to heat.
- [ ] **Which floor?**
    - **Top floor apartments** are quieter; you hear traffic less, and there are no neighbours above you. They get more sunlight, but they are hotter in the summer, especially old apartments with bad insulation.[^12] Attic apartments (*[[Dachgeschosswohnung]]*) feel smaller because of [angled walls and wooden beams](/images/dachgeschosswohnung-berlin.jpg).
    - **Upper floor apartments** get more sunlight. There is less traffic noise. Check if there is an elevator.
    - **Lower floors and ground floor appartments** are darker and louder. Break-ins can happen. Neighbours can see inside your apartment.[^13] Some ground floor apartments have a garden.
- [ ] **Elevator?**  
    If you live on a higher floor, check if your building has an elevator.
- [ ] **Street or courtyard?**  
    Which side is the apartment on? On the street side, you hear traffic more. On the courtyard side, you hear other neighbours more. The courtyard side gets less sun.
- [ ] **Storage and parking**  
    Is there a place for your bicycle? A storage room in the basement (*Kellerraum*)? How much does a parking space cost? Is there street parking?
- [ ] **Do you need a [WBS](/glossary/Wohnberechtigungsschein)?**  
    Some apartments require a *[[Wohnberechtigungsschein]]*. If you don't have one, you can't live there.
- [ ] **Internet access**  
    Some buildings can't get a fast internet connection. Use [this tool](https://www.check24.de/dsl/verfuegbarkeit/) to see your internet options.
- [ ] **Pets**  
    Are pets allowed? Cats are usually allowed, but not dogs.
- [ ] **Amenities**  
    In general, German apartment buildings don't have a pool or a gym. Some might have a shared garden or bicycle storage.

### Location checklist

- [ ] **Neighbourhood**  
    Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Neukölln are popular neighbourhoods, but there are other options. A less popular neighbourhood can be cheaper, safer and quieter. Berlin has good public transit; you don't need to live in the central areas. Look for places outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*
- [ ] **Public transit access**  
    How is the train or tram connection? Berlin has good public transit. You don't need to live in the centre. Use [Mapnificent](https://www.mapnificent.net/berlin/) and Google Maps to measure your commute.
- [ ] **Crime**  
    Use the [crime atlas](https://www.kriminalitaetsatlas.berlin.de/K-Atlas/atlas.html) to find a safe area. Areas next to some big train stations (Alexanderplatz, Görlitzer Bahnhof, Kottbusser Tor, Hermannplatz, Leopoldplatz) are more dangerous.[^14] There are more drunk people, drug addicts, street fights, vandalism and theft in those areas. You don't need to avoid the entire area, just the busy streets.
- [ ] **Parking**  
    [You don't need a car in Berlin](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car). Is enough street parking? Do you need a [parking permit](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany#parking)? Does your building have basement parking? How much does it cost? You can [park motorcycles on the sidewalk](/guides/motorcycle-parking).
- [ ] **Nearby services**  
    Check if there are supermarkets, [Spätis](/glossary/Späti), cafés and other businesses nearby.
- [ ] **Noise**  
    Main roads are noisy because of cars, trams and ambulances.[^15] Ambulances, trams and trains are *very* loud, even when you close your windows.[^16] Nearby restaurants, bars and [Spätis](/glossary/Späti) can be loud, even at night. - [Noise map of Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/umweltatlas/verkehr-laerm/laermbelastung/2022/karten/artikel.1305256.php)

[![Berlin busy areas](/images/berlin-busy-areas.png "In Google Maps, orange areas are interesting areas. They have good bars and restaurants, but they are busy and loud.")](/images/berlin-busy-areas.png)

[![Berlin tram lines](/images/berlin-tram-lines.png "If you live next to a tram line, you hear trams all day. They are very loud.")](/images/berlin-tram-lines.png)

## 3. Contact the landlord

When you find an apartment you like, contact the landlord and ask to visit the apartment. Do not wait.

Write a short message that includes...[^30]

- [ ] Your occupation ⭐️
- [ ] Your salary ⭐️
- [ ] Your name (and doctor title)
- [ ] Your age
- [ ] Your residence status: residence permit, permanent residence, EU citizenship
- [ ] When you want to move in
- [ ] Who will move in with you
- [ ] A unique personal introduction
- [ ] A photo of you (optional, but it helps)[^31]
- [ ] Anything that [landlords want](#what-landlords-want)

Write in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to translate your message. Use the [example messages](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/artikel/accommodation-search-example-of-a-successful-flat-application) from WG-Gesucht.

Do not send all your documents yet. It just annoys landlords.[^52]

To improve your chances...

- **Be fast**  
    If you like an apartment, do not wait. Landlords get hundreds of messages per hour.[^22] Most apartment listings disappear after a few minutes.[^26] Use [bots, notifications and message templates](#bots-and-automation) to apply faster. Get ImmoScout24 Premium to message landlords before others.[^1]
- **Don't be picky**  
    You probably won't get a cheap apartment in a cool neighbourhood. Be ready to take what you find. If you are a recent immigrant, [your options](#your-housing-options) are limited.
- **Send a lot of messages**  
    You might need to send hundreds of messages to get a few visits. Searching for an apartment is a full time job. It can take months.
- **Be prepared**  
    Prepare all the [required documents](#required-documents) in advance. Be ready to send them quickly.
- **Write and call**  
    Most landlords prefer emails, but some prefer calls.[^35] Try both.
- **Have a detailed profile**  
    Create a detailed profile on housing websites, and upload your documents. It helps you make a good impression when you message a landlord.
- **Be brief**  
    Don't make landlords read. Write message short and simple messages. Only send the important parts of your documents.

### What landlords want

Landlords want **stability**. They want quiet tenants who pay rent on time.

In order, they prefer...[^32]

- Couples without children 👍 👍 👍
- Single people without children 👍 👍
- Families with children 👍
- Retirees 👎
- Students 👎 👎
- Single parents 👎 👎
- [Shared apartments](/glossary/WG) 👎 👎 👎

Landlords prefer...

- **A good income**  
    Your rent should be 20% to 40% of your monthly [net income](/glossary/Netto%20income).[^34] Your income can't be too low or too high.[^48] Two incomes are better than one.
- **A stable job**  
    If you are in your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), it's a little harder to find an apartment.[^36] If you are self-employed, it's much harder.[^17] If you are unemployed, it's impossible.
- **A good first impression**  
    Be nice and pleasant. Your personality matters a lot.[^29]
- **A stable right of residence**  
    You must have a long-term right to live in Germany. If you have a [[National Visa]], it's harder to find an apartment. If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa) or no visa, it's *much* harder. If you are a recent immigrant, you can get a [short-term furnished apartment](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) or a room in a [[WG]].
- **German speakers**  
    If you speak German, it's less work for the landlord. Write in German. Use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to translate messages.
- **Titles**  
    Landlords prefer doctors and professors.[^10] Use your title (*Dr* or *Prof*) when you write to the landlord.

Landlords often avoid...

- **Recent immigrants**  
    They are more likely to lose their job, lose their residence permit or move away. Discrimination also happens.[^9] Some landlords *prefer* immigrants because they pay more and don't know their rights.[^25]
- **People who know their rights**  
    Landlords avoid people who know the rules, like lawyers and government employees.[^24]
- Parents[^29]
- Students
- [Dog owners](/guides/dog-ownership#finding-an-apartment-with-a-dog)

## 4. Visit the apartment

If you are lucky, you will get invited to an apartment viewing. Arrive early. Bring all the [required documents](#required-documents). You can usually apply for the apartment at the end of the visit.

It can be a private viewing (just you) or an open viewing (many other people). Don't go to a viewing with more than 40 people; they are usually a waste of time.[^20]

When you visit apartments, your travel costs are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). You can deduct 0.30€ per kilometre.

### Apartment viewing checklist

- [ ] **Noise**  
    How is the soundproofing? Can you hear the neighbours? Can you hear the noise outside? Traffic, ambulances, bars and other noise can be a problem.
- [ ] **Neighbours**  
    Check who your neighbours are. Children and dogs can make a lot of noise. If you visit the apartment during the day, it can be quieter than in the evening, when all your neighbours are at home.
- [ ] **Mold**  
    Look for [mold stains](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moldy_livingroom_Panewniki_01.jpg) around windows and in the corners of the rooms. Mold problems can be hard to fix.
- [ ] **Hausordnung**  
    Each building has different house rules (*[[Hausordnung]]*). It has rules about [quiet hours](/guides/quiet-hours), grilling, ventilation, musical instruments, vehicles and pets.[^40]
- [ ] **Appliances**  
    Check what appliances fit in the apartment. Do you need a smaller washing machine? Is there room for a dishwasher? Does your bed fit in the bedroom?

### Visiting a flat share

*[[WG]]* visits are more like an interview. You meet your future roommates, and you decide if you like each other.[^41] Some interviews are very informal: you might meet to have a drink or even play board games together.

The interview for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* is usually shorter. Your roommate wants to save money. They don't care so much about being your friend.

### How to behave during the visit

- **Dress well**  
    Make a good impression. You don't need a suit, just clean clothes, clean shoes, and socks without holes.[^11]
- **Be on time**  
    Arrive a little early. You will have more time to find the place and meet the landlord. If you are late, tell the landlord as soon as you can.[^28]
- **Be pleasant**  
    Be polite and friendly. Greet the landlord or the agent. Speak German if you can. It's important to make a good impression.
- **Don't complain**  
    If you start finding problems with the apartment, you look like you will be a difficult tenant.
- **Don't negotiate**  
    The rent is not negotiable. There are dozens of other people who want this apartment. The price will not go down, and you won't get the apartment.

## 5. Apply for the apartment

If you like the apartment, apply for it as soon as you can. Send the [required documents](#required-documents). You can sometimes apply during the viewing.

![Berlin apartment documents](/illustrations/berlin-apartment-documents.png)

### Required documents

To apply for an apartment, you need these documents:[^19]

- [ ] **[[Schufa]] report**  
    You can [get one for free](/guides/schufa). It's also included with the ImmoScout24 premium account. If you can't get a Schufa, bring more proofs of income. Furnished apartments from [Homelike](/out/homelike), [HousingAnywhere](/out/housinganywhere), [Spotahome](/out/spotahome) and [Wunderflats](/out/wunderflats) don't ask for a Schufa.
- [ ] **Proof of income** (*Einkommensnachweis*)
    - **If you are an employee**  
        Bring your work contract or a [certificate of employment](/glossary/Arbeitgeberbescheinigung), and your last 3 [payslips](/glossary/Gehaltsabrechnung). A certificate of employment is better than a contract, because it's easier to read.
    - **If you are self-employed**  
        Bring a profit and loss statement stamped by your [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater), or a recent *[[Steuerbescheid]]*. A *betriebswirtschaftliche Auswertung* also works. [Bank account statements](/glossary/Kontoauszug) help, but landlords trust them less.[^38]
    - **If you are a student**  
        Bring a *[[Mietbürgschaft]]*, and proof of your guarantor's income.[^5]
- [ ] **[[Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung]]** (optional)  
    This document proves that you don't owe money to your previous landlord. You get it from your previous landlord. It does not have a standard format, but you can use [this template](/documents/Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung-muster.pdf). You can also use bank statements to show that you pay rent every month.[^47]
- [ ] **[[Mietbürgschaft]]** (optional)  
    If you have a low or unstable income, someone can be your guarantor. If you don't pay rent, they must pay it for you. It's useful for students and freelancers. Use [this *Mietbürgschaft* template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyhRVDPmmzkER5ElnPSlAR3J5ohw2j32/view).
- [ ] **Passport or [[Personalausweis]]**
- [ ] **Application form** (optional)  
    If an agency listed the apartment, download their application form (*Selbstauskunft*) and fill it in advance.
- [ ] **Proof of [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung)** (very optional)  
    Landlords can't require liability insurance, but some ask for it anyway. Having it can make a small difference. You should have liability insurance anyway.[^53] - [More information](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)
- [ ] **Copies of everything**  
    Use them to apply for the apartment during the visit. Keep the originals.

**Combine your documents** with a [PDF merging tool](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html). Landlords prefer to get a single PDF.[^42]

**Make your documents easy to read.** Remove useless pages, and highlight the important information.[^4] Make it easy for landlords.

**Censor and [watermark](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/add-watermark) your documents** before you send them. It helps prevent identity theft.

## 6. Sign the lease and move in

If the landlord chooses you, they will ask for your documents. Send everything as a single PDF.

You will sign a lease, pay the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution), get the keys and move in. You must register your address, put your name on the mailbox, and change your address. Be careful, it can still be a [scam](/guides/housing-scams).

**[How to sign the lease and move in ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

![Apartment keys](/illustrations/apartment-keys.png)

## Your housing options

Your options depends on your situation.

**If you are not in Berlin yet**, it's impossible to find a long-term apartment. Landlords always pick someone else. It's very hard to find a room in a [[WG]] without meeting the other tenants in person. You must get [short-term housing](#short-term-housing), move to Berlin, then look for something better.

**If you are a recent immigrant**, it's harder to find an apartment. You need more time to look for an apartment. You might need [short-term housing](#short-term-housing) while you search. Always get a place where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). [It's very important.](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address)

### Short-term housing

Short-term, furnished apartments are a **temporary solution**. Use them to [move to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin), then find something better. If you are not in Germany yet, it might be your only option.

Furnished apartments are...

- **Immigrant-friendly**  
    You can book them long before you arrive in Germany. You don't need to speak German. You don't need a stable job, a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), a *[[Schufa]]* or a [deposit](/glossary/Kaution).
- **Convenient**  
    They include everything you need: furniture, appliances, cookware, internet and electricity. You can just [move in](/guides/moving-in) and focus on other problems.
- **Temporary**  
    You have a short-term lease. You must move out when your lease ends. Usually, you can't move out early, and you can't stay longer.
- **Overpriced**  
    They are 60% more expensive than regular apartments.[^37] They are a really bad deal. If you have a low budget, rent a room in a [[WG]].

**Furnished rooms** in a [[WG]] are cheaper. People often sublet their rooms while they travel. You can live there for a few weeks. Usually, you can't do your *[[Anmeldung]]* there, and [that can be a problem](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address).

There are also [**hotels and hostels** where you can do your *Anmeldung*](https://nomadandinlove.com/anmeldung-apartment-hotels-berlin/).

Start looking for short-term housing as soon as you know your move-in date.[^54] You can usually book it long in advance.

**[Look for short-term housing ↑](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments)**

### Regular apartment

Regular apartments are a **long-term solution**. They are hard to get, because everyone wants them. If you are unemployed, if you are a student, or if you are not in Germany yet, regular apartments are almost impossible to get.

With a regular apartment...

- **Nothing is included**  
    They come with no furniture, appliances, light fixtures or curtains. They are completely empty. You must buy everything yourself. You must also get an internet contract and an electricity contract. In Berlin, they must come with a stove and a sink.[^3]
- **You can stay forever**  
    The lease is unlimited (*unbefristet*). Once you move in, it's your home. It's really hard to kick you out. You must give a [3-month notice](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist) before you [move out](/guides/moving-out).
- **You save money in the long term**  
    You must buy everything for the apartment, but the rent is much lower. Over time, you save a lot of money.

Start looking for a regular apartments 1 to 3 months before you [move in](/guides/moving-in). The rent should be 20% to 40% of your monthly [net income](/glossary/Netto%20income).[^34]

**[Look for a regular apartment ↑](#look-for-apartments)**

### Room in a [[WG]]

Renting a room in a [shared apartment](/glossary/WG) is a **cheaper long-term solution**. Rooms in a WG are really hard to find.[^6]

Usually, you must meet your roommates for an interview. Most WG interviews are like a personality test or a culture fit test. Interviews for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* are more formal.

Rooms in a WG are...

- **Cheaper**  
    You split the rent, internet, electricity, [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag) and other bills with other people. Since the rent is lower, the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) is also lower.
- **Convenient**  
    Your roommates already have some furniture and cookware that you can use. The internet and utilities are already connected. You might only need furniture for your room. You don't need to furnish a whole apartment.

Sometimes, people sublet their furnished room while they travel. These short-term rooms are much easier to find. Usually, you can't [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) there, and [that can be a problem](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address).

**[Look for a room in a WG ↑](#wgs-flat-shares-and-roommates)**

### Student housing

Student dorms are the **cheapest option for students**, but they are hard to get. There are long waiting lists.[^43] It's only available for public universities and *some* private universities.[^56]

**[How to apply for student housing](https://www.stw.berlin/wohnen/faq-wohnen/wie-bewerbe-ich-mich-um-einen-wohnplatz.html)** (in German) - StudierendenWERK Berlin

You can also get luxury student housing. It's very expensive, but it's easier to get, and it comes with everything you need.

**[Look for student housing ↑](#dorms-and-student-housing)**

### Buying an apartment

If you just moved to Berlin, **don't buy an apartment**. Buying is harder than renting. If you just started a new job, you won't get a mortgage. If you don't have EU citizenship or [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you won't get a mortgage. If you don't know the housing market well, you can make really bad decisions.

## Important knowledge

### Anmeldung

The *[[Anmeldung]]* is really important. Always choose a place where the *Anmeldung* is allowed. If you can't register your address, it makes your life much harder.

**[Why the Anmeldung is important ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address)**

### Deposit

Almost all apartments require a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). It's usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You get it back after you [move out](/guides/moving-out). You can [pay it in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You must pay the first instalment before you [move in](/guides/moving-in). If you don't have enough money, there are [other options](/guides/mietkaution#if-you-dont-have-enough-money).

Some short-term apartments on [HousingAnywhere](/out/housinganywhere) and [Spotahome](/out/spotahome) apartments don't ask for a deposit.

**[How the deposit works ➞](/guides/mietkaution)**

### Cold rent and warm rent

The warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*) is what you pay every month. It's the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) plus utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*).

The *Nebenkosten* usually include:

- Heating (most of the time)
- Hot water (most of the time)
- Trash collection
- Cleaning and landscaping

The *Nebenkosten* are not a fixed cost, because you don't know how much water and heating you really use. Your landlord adjusts the *Nebenkosten* every year based on your usage. You pay what your landlord pays. Your landlord can't make a profit on *Nebenkosten*.

### Nothing is included

Apartments usually come without a washing machine, curtains, light fixtures or a furnished kitchen (stove, fridge, sink). You must buy your own, or buy them from the previous tenant. In Berlin, apartments *must* include a stove and a sink,[^3] but not in the rest of Germany.

[Furnished apartments](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) come with the kitchen, furniture and everything you need, but they are much more expensive.

Sometimes, the previous tenant wants to sell their furniture to you. If you don't buy the furniture, you don't get the apartment. The price is often really high, because they know that you want the apartment. It's a [common scam](/guides/housing-scams#buy-the-furniture-to-get-the-flat).

### Rent is paid by bank transfer

You usually pay rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). You rarely pay rent with cash, and never with cheques. If the landlord uses another payment method, it's probably a [scam](/guides/housing-scams).

You need a European bank account to make bank transfers. Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from a non-EU country.

**[Open a bank account ➞](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**

### Rooms and floors

Rooms and floors are not counted the same way everywhere.

In Germany, the living room also counts as a room. A studio is a *1 Zimmer Wohnung*. A 2-bedroom apartment with a living room is a *3 Zimmer Wohnung*. The kitchen, the bathroom and the hallway do not count as rooms.

[![Apartment floor plan berlin](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)

In many countries, the first floor is the ground floor. In Germany, the first floor is above the ground floor.

[![Floors/stories of a German building](/images/building-floors.jpg)](/images/building-floors.jpg)

## Need help?

A [real estate agent](#real-estate-agents) can help you find an apartment. A *[[Mieterverein]]* or a [lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can answer your legal questions. Join a *[[Mieterverein]]* or get [legal insurance](/glossary/Rechtsschutzversicherung) before you need it.
