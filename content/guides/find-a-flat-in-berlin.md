## Is it hard to find an apartment?

**Yes, it's really hard**. It can take months and hundreds of applications.[^0] It's much harder for recent immigrants. It's one of the hardest parts of [moving to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin). You might live in multiple temporary places before you find something permanent.[^23] It can be hard on your mental health.[^2]

**[What landlords want ↓](#what-landlords-want)**

## Before you start

Before you [look for apartments](#step-1-look-for-apartments), you should...

- [ ] **Understand [how things work](#important-knowledge) in Germany**  
    Housing is a little different in Germany. Learn about those small differences.
- [ ] **Know [your options](#your-housing-options)**  
    Should you get an apartment, a furnished apartment, a bedroom in a [[WG]] or student housing? It depends on your situation.
- [ ] **Save money**  
    You must pay the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) and the first rent. The deposit is usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You must also [buy furniture, appliances, and house supplies](/guides/where-to-buy-what#furniture-and-house-supplies).
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**  
    Germans pay their rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). If you can't open a bank account, use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to send money from another country.
- [ ] **Create accounts on housing websites**  
    Make complete, detailed profiles on [ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/), [Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/) and [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/). You will need them to apply for apartments. A detailed profile improves your chances.
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    To find an apartment, you have to be fast. You must have your documents ready.

## Step 1: Look for apartments

### Ask everyone

- **People you know**  
    Tell your friends, family, colleagues and classmates that you need a place to live. People often find an apartment like this.[^21]
- **Your [[Hausverwaltung]]**  
    Landlords prefer people they already know. They might give you priority when they have an apartment for rent.
- **Your university**  
    Universities have boards with apartment listings, and help clinics for new students.[^7]

### Apartment search websites

- **[ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)**  
    The main housing website. You should pay for the premium account.[^1]
- **[Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de:443/)** - Biggest classified ads site
- **[Immowelt](https://www.immowelt.de/)** - Second biggest apartment listing site

### Real estate agents

People don't hire agents to find an apartment. They are mostly useless.[^10] They cost a lot of money, but they don't improve your chances. Many agents only accept clients with a high budget (over 3,000€ per month).

### Other tricks

- Install the [Kleinanzeigen](https://themen.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/mobile-apps/) and [ImmoScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/mobile-services/) apps, and enable notifications for new apartment listings.[^44]
- Follow [@berlinflatsbot on Telegram](https://t.me/berlinflatsbot)
- Turn on push notifications for the Facebook housing groups you follow.

## Step 2: Choose apartments to visit

### Apartment checklist

- [ ] **[Is it a scam?](/guides/housing-scams)**
- [ ] **Is the price fair?**  
    The [ImmobilienScout24 rent atlas](https://atlas.immobilienscout24.de/) shows rent prices in the area. Furnished apartments are often much more expensive.
- [ ] **Can you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) there?**  
    Always choose an apartment that lets you do your *Anmeldung*. [It's very important.](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address)
- [ ] **Is the lease unlimited?**  
    Look for an unlimited (*unbefristet*) contract. A short-term lease means that you must move again in a few months. [Many fixed-term leases are illegal](/guides/housing-scams#short-term-lease).
- [ ] **What is included?**  
    Apartments often come without appliances, curtains, and light fixtures. When an apartment is *mit [[Einbauküche]]*, it includes a stove, fridge and sometimes a dishwasher. You must buy your own washing machine. [[WG]]s and furnished apartments usually include everything you need.
- [ ] **How is the housing company?**  
    Search the name of your landlord or housing company (*[[Hausverwaltung]]*). Some have a really bad reputation.
- [ ] **Neubau or Altbau?**  
    New buildings (*Neubau*) are often quieter and better insulated. They have concrete walls and floors. You hear your neighbours less. Old buildings (*Altbau*) often have high ceilings, hardwood floors, and a lot more charm.
- [ ] **Gas or electric?**  
    Some apartments have gas heating and gas stoves.
- [ ] **Which floor?**
    - **Top floor**   
        These apartments are quieter; you hear less traffic, and there is no neighbour above you. They get more sunlight. They are hotter in the summer,[^12] especially old apartments with bad insulation. Ask if they improved the insulation in the recent years. If you live in the attic (*Dachgeschoß*), the walls are at an angle, so the apartment can feel smaller.
    - **Upper floors**  
        These apartments get more sunlight. There is less traffic noise. Check if there is an elevator.
    - **Lower floors, ground floor**  
        Apartments on the lower floors are darker and louder. They are less safe because of break-ins. Neighbours can often see inside your apartment.[^13] Some ground floor apartments have a garden.
- [ ] **Street or courtyard?**  
    Does the apartment face the street or the courtyard? On the street side, you hear the traffic more. On the courtyard side, you hear your other neighbours more. The courtyard side gets less sun.
- [ ] **Storage and parking**  
    Is there a rack for your bicycle? A storage room in the basement (*Kellerraum*)? Is street parking easy to find? Is there a parking space in the basement? How much does it cost?

### Location checklist

- **Neighbourhood**  
    Berlin has a few popular neighbourhoods (*Kiez*): Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Neukölln, etc. These neighbourhoods are more interesting, but they are busier, louder and more expensive. There is a lot of competition for apartments in those areas. To save money or live in a quiet area, look for apartments outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*.
- **Public transit connections and commute time**  
    Berlin has good public transportation. You can live far from the centre if you live close to a train or tram station. Use [Mapnificient](https://www.mapnificent.net/berlin/) to see how far you are from work.
- **Crime**  
    Berlin is a safe city, even at night, but some parts are less safe. The areas next to big train stations (Alexanderplatz, Görlitzer Bahnhof, Kottbusser Tor, Hermannplatz) are more dangerous.[^14] There are more drunk people, drug addicts, street fights, vandalism and theft in those areas, but people will still leave you alone. You don't need to avoid the entire area, just the busy streets. Use the [crime atlas](https://www.kriminalitaetsatlas.berlin.de/K-Atlas/atlas.html) to find a safe area.
- **Noise**  
    Main roads are very noisy because of trams, cars and ambulances.[^15] Ambulances, trams and trains are *very* loud. You can hear even with your windows closed.[^16] Busy areas with lots of bars and restaurants are also loud, even late at night. Google Maps shows the busy areas in orange. If you want a quiet apartment, don't live in those areas. The [noise map](https://www.berlin.de/umweltatlas/verkehr-laerm/laermbelastung/2022/karten/artikel.1305256.php) can help. The big red line is from Tegel airport, which closed in 2020.[^17]

![Berlin ambulance noise](/illustrations/berlin-ambulance-noise.png)

- **Parking**  
    [You don't need a car in Berlin](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car). If you want a car, check if there is enough parking space nearby. In central neighbourhoods, parking spaces are harder to find, and you need a [parking permit](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany#parking). Your building might have a basement garage. Basement parking costs around 120€ per month. Single garages are harder to find. You can [park your motorcycle on the sidewalk](/guides/motorcycle-parking).
- **Parks and nature**  
    Berlin is one of the greenest cities in Europe.[^18] There are many parks and green spaces, even in the centre. To be closer to nature, live near [[Brandenburg]] or [Grunewald](https://goo.gl/maps/7bo9CKBKtQ8ysHB46).

### Common apartment scams

**[Common housing scams ➞](/guides/housing-scams)**

## Step 3: Contact the landlord

After you find apartments you like, contact the landlord now. Here are ways to improve your chances:

- **Speak or write in German**  
    You get more responses if you write in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to write your message.
- **Call and write**  
    Some landlords only answer phone calls. Others only answer emails. Try both.
- **Introduce yourself**  
    In your message, include all important details: name, age, job, salary, when you want to move in, who will live with you, what documents you have, and a personal introduction.[^30] A cover letter and a photo helps.[^31] Use [example messages](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/artikel/accommodation-search-example-of-a-successful-flat-application) to write your message.
- **Send many applications**  
    Some people send hundreds of applications before they find an apartment.
- **Be prepared**  
    Landlords get hundreds of messages and dozens of applications *per hour*.[^22] Make their life as easy as possible. Fill the application form in advance, and bring all the [required documents](#required-documents) with you.
- **Be flexible**  
    There are really nice apartments outside of Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain or Neukölln. Search in all of Berlin, including outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*. Berlin has good public transportation; you don't need to live in the center.
- **Be fast**  
    If you find an apartment you like, act fast. Contact the landlord now.[^32] They get hundreds of message a day, so you can't wait. If you get ImmobilienScout24 Premium, you see the ads before others, and your messages go to the top of the list.[^33]

### What landlords want

**Stability.** Landlords prefer quiet, long-term tenants who pay their rent on time. They want to avoid problems.

Landlords want tenants with...

- **A good income**  
    Your rent should be between 20% and 40% of your monthly [[Netto income]].[^34] If your income is too low or too high, you might not get the apartment. Two incomes are better than one. If you have a good salary, say it in your introduction message. Your income can be too high.[^48] {# How high is too high? #}
- **A stable job**  
    It's harder to find an apartment if you are self-employed, or if you are on your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit). If you have a good job, mention it in your introduction message.
- **A stable right of residence**  
    You should have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or EU citizenship. If you don't have that, get a [short-term furnished apartment](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments).
- **German speakers**  
    If you speak German, it's less work for the landlord.
- **No dogs, no pets**  
    It's much harder to find an apartment that allows dogs. Some websites let you filter for apartments that allow pets.
- **No foreigners**  
    People with foreign names get fewer responses and more rejections.[^9] Landlords prefer long-term residents. Recent immigrants are not stable tenants. Some landlord *prefer* foreigners because they pay more and don't know their rights.[^25]

## Step 4: Visit the apartment

If you are lucky, the landlord will invite you to see the apartment. Arrive early and bring all the required documents. It might be a private visit (just you), or an open visit (many other people).

Do not go to mass viewings. They are a waste of time.[^20]

You can usually apply for the apartment during your visit.

### Required documents

To get the apartment, **come prepared**. Bring a copy of all your documents with you. If you like the apartment, you can apply during the visit.

![Berlin apartment documents](/illustrations/berlin-apartment-documents.png)

Bring these documents with you:[^19]

- [ ] **[[Schufa]] report**  
    This is like a credit report. You can [get one for free](/guides/schufa). If you are new in Germany, your *[[Schufa]]* is empty. You can bring a work contract or a tax return, to prove that you make enough money. Furnished apartments from [Homelike](/out/homelike), [Spotahome](/out/spotahome), [Wunderflats](/out/wunderflats) don't ask for a Schufa.[^37]
- [ ] **Passport or [[Personalausweis]]**  
    You must show it when you apply for the apartment. Bring photocopies of your ID, just in case.
- [ ] **Proof of income**  
    Bring a work contract, your last 3 pay slips, or your last *[[Steuerbescheid]]*. If you are a freelancer, bring a profit-and-loss statement. If you don't make enough money, you can get a *[[Mietbürgschaft]]*.
- [ ] **Bank account statement** (optional)  
    This shows how much money you have in your bank account. If you are a freelancer, bring one.[^38]
- [ ] **Employment contract** (optional)  
    Some landlords want to see your employment contract.[^39] It proves that you have a stable income. It's harder to find an apartment during your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit).
- [ ] **[[Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung]]** (optional)  
    This document proves that you don't owe money to your previous landlord. You get it from your previous landlord. It does not have a standard format, but you can use [this template](/documents/Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung-muster.pdf). You can also use bank statements to show that you pay rent every month.[^47]
- [ ] **[[Mietbürgschaft]]** (optional)  
    If you don't have a stable income, a parent or a friend can be your guarantor. If you don't pay the rent on time, your guarantor must pay it for you. This is a good option for students, freelancers and people with a low income. Use [this *Mietbürgschaft* template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyhRVDPmmzkER5ElnPSlAR3J5ohw2j32/view).
- [ ] **Application form** (optional)  
    If an agency listed the apartment, download their application form and fill it in advance. If you like the apartment you visit, you can apply immediately. You can usually find the application form on their website.
- [ ] **Copies of everything**

You must send your personal documents to people you don't know. Identity theft is a big risk.[^24] To protect yourself, [censor your documents](/guides/housing-scams#censor-your-documents).

### What to look for?

- **Appliances**  
    Check what appliances fit in the apartment. Do you need a smaller washing machine? Is there room for a dishwasher? Does your bed fit in the bedroom?
- **Hausordnung**  
    Each building has different house rules (*[[Hausordnung]]*). For example, some buildings have [quiet hours](/guides/quiet-hours) from 13:00 to 16:00.[^40] The *Hausordnung* often has rules about quiet hours, BBQs, ventilation, musical instruments, vehicles and pets.
- **Neighbours**  
    Check who your neighbours are. For example, if they have pets and children, you will sometimes hear them. If you visit the apartment during the day, it can be quieter than in the evening, when all your neighbours are at home.
- **Noise**  
    Can you hear the noise outside? Traffic, ambulances, bars and other noise can be a problem.
- **Pets**  
    Are pets allowed in this apartment? Most apartment listings show this information.
- **Internet access**  
    Some buildings can't get a fast internet connection. Use [this tool](https://www.check24.de/dsl/verfuegbarkeit/) to see what internet options are available there.

### Visiting a flat share

If you visit a *[[WG]]*, the process is different. It's not a visit, but an interview. You meet your future roommates, and they decide if they like you.[^41] These interviews can be very informal: you might meet to have a drink or even play board games together. This takes a lot of your time.

The interview for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* is usually shorter. Your roommate wants to save money. They don't care so much about being your friend.

## Step 5: Sign the lease and move in

You will sign a lease, pay the deposit, get the keys and move in. You must register your address, put your name on the mailbox, and change your address.

**[How to move out ➞](/guides/moving-out)**

**[How to move in ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

## Step 6: Get insured

There are 3 types of insurance that cover your apartment:

1. **[Liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung)** (*Haftpflichtversicherung*)  
    It covers damage to other people's things. For example, if you spill water and destroy the floor, or if you [lose your keys](/guides/lost-keys) and they must replace all the locks in the building. Everyone should have liability insurance. - [More information](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)
2. **[Legal insurance](/glossary/Rechtsschutzversicherung)** (*Rechtsschutzversicherung*)  
    If you have problems with your landlord, it pays for the legal costs. Landlords often take advantage of immigrants. Legal insurance allows you to defend yourself. It's optional, but good to have. - [More information](/guides/legal-insurance)
3. **[Household insurance](/glossary/Hausratversicherung)** (*Hausratversicherung*)  
    It covers your things against theft and fires. It can also cover your bicycle. It's useful if you can't afford to replace your things.

## Important knowledge

### Deposit

Almost all apartments require a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). It's usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You get it back when you [move out](/guides/moving-out). You can [pay it in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You must pay the first instalment before you [move in](/guides/moving-in).

**[How the deposit works ➞](/guides/mietkaution)**

### Cold rent and warm rent

The warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*) is what you pay every month. It's the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) plus utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*).

The *Nebenkosten* usually include:

- Heating
- Hot water (most of the time)
- Trash collection
- Cleaning and landscaping

The *Nebenkosten* are not a fixed cost, because you don't know how much water and heating you really use. Your landlord adjusts the *Nebenkosten* every year based on your usage. You pay what your landlord pays. Your landlord can't make a profit on *Nebenkosten*.

### Nothing is included

Apartments usually come without a washing machine, curtains, light fixtures or a furnished kitchen (stove, fridge, sink). You must buy your own, or buy them from the previous tenant. In Berlin, apartments *must* include a stove and a sink,[^3] but not in the rest of Germany. [Furnished apartments](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) come with the kitchen, furniture and everything else.

### Rent is paid by bank transfer

You usually pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). You rarely pay the rent with cash, and never with cheques.

You need a European bank account to make bank transfers. You can also use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from a non-EU country.

### Rooms and floors

Rooms and floors are not counted the same way everywhere.

In Germany, the living room also counts as a room. A studio is a *1 Zimmer Wohnung*. A 2-bedroom apartment with a living room is a *3 Zimmer Wohnung*. The kitchen, the bathroom and the hallway do not count as rooms.

[![Apartment floor plan berlin](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)

In many countries, the first floor is the ground floor. In Germany, the first floor is above the ground floor.

[![Floors/stories of a German building](/images/building-floors.jpg)](/images/building-floors.jpg)

## Your housing options

### Regular apartment

Regular apartments come without furniture, appliances, light fixtures, curtains or cookware. They are empty. In Berlin, apartments must come with a stove and a sink.[^3] You must buy everything else yourself. You must also get an internet connection and find an electricity company.

Regular apartments are a good **long-term solution**, because they are cheaper. There is a lot of competition for those apartments, so they are hard to find.

A regular apartment is cheaper in the long term. Your rent is lower, because you don't rent the furniture with it.

**[Look for regular apartments ↓](#step-1-look-for-apartments)**

### Short-term, furnished apartment

Short-term apartments are very expensive, but they come with everything you need. They are a good **short-term solution** when you [move to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin).

Short-term apartments have many benefits:

- **Fully furnished**  
    They come with everything you need: furniture, appliances and cookware. You don't need to get an internet contract, an electricity contract, furniture, appliances or cookware. 
- **Internet and utilities included**  
    The internet and utilities are already connected. You can just move in, and focus on other problems.
- **Immigrant-friendly**  
    You can book an apartment before you arrive in Germany. They don't ask for documents that immigrants don't have, like a *[[Schufa]]*.
- **Less competition**  
    These apartments are overpriced, and too expensive for most people. There is less competition for them, so they are a little easier to find.

Some furnished apartments have a booking fee or a cleaning fee.[^4] If you rent for less than 6 months, you might pay {{ VAT_RATE }}% [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) (included in the price).[^5]

**[Look for short-term apartments ↓](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments)**

### Flat share ([[WG]])

Sharing an apartment with other people is cheaper and easier. They are a **budget-friendly solution**.

Shared apartments have many benefits:

- **Shared costs**  
    You can split the cost of rent, internet, electricity, [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag) and other bills. You save a lot of money.
- **Lower deposit**  
    Your part of the rent is lower, so your part of the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) is also lower. If you don't have a lot of savings, a [[WG]] could be your only option.
- **Many things included**  
    Your roommates might already have most of the furniture and cookware you need. You don't need to buy everything yourself. The internet and utilities are already connected.

Finding a [[WG]] is a little easier than finding a full apartment, but still very hard.[^6]

Usually, you must meet your roommates for an interview. Most WG interviews are like a personality test or culture fit test. Interviews for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* are more formal.

### Student housing

Student dorms are the **cheapest option for students**, but they are hard to get. Student housing has long waiting lists.

There is also luxury student housing. It's very expensive, but it comes with everything you need.

### Buying an apartment

If you just moved to Berlin, **don't buy an apartment**. Buying is even harder than renting. If you just started a new job, you won't get a mortgage. If you don't have EU citizenship or [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you won't get a mortgage.
