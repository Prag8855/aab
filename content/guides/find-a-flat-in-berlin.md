## Is it hard to find an apartment?

**Yes**. It's really hard.[^0] You must send hundreds of applications to find something.[^1] It can take months to find an apartment.

During your search, you might need a temporary place to live. For example, you can stay with a friend, or rent a [temporary furnished apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#furnished-apartment).

### Finding your first apartment

If you just [moved to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin), it's harder to find an apartment. You are on your [probation ](/glossary/Probezeit)period, you have no [credit history](/glossary/Schufa), and you might not have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) yet. Landlords prefer more stable tenants.

It's easier to find an apartment if you are already in Berlin. You can visit apartments in person, and avoid scams. If you look for a [flat share](/glossary/WG), you can meet potential roommates face to face.[^2]

## Before you start

### Get everything you need

You must do this before you apply for apartments:

- [**Open a bank account**](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)  
    You usually pay the rent by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung) from a European bank account. You can also send money from another country with [Wise](/out/transferwise).
- **Save money**  
    You need enough money to pay the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) and the first month of rent. The deposit is usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You will also need to [buy furniture, appliances, and house supplies](/guides/where-to-buy-what#furniture-and-house-supplies).
- **Prepare your documents**  
    Get all the [documents you need](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#what-to-bring) to apply for an apartment. If you find a place you like, you must apply quickly.

### Things that are different in Germany

- **The deposit**  
    Almost all apartments require a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). It's usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You get it back when you [move out](/guides/moving-out). You can [pay it in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#pay-in-instalments). - [More about the deposit](/guides/mietkaution)
- **Cold rent and warm rent**  
    In Germany, there is the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) and the warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*). The warm rent is the cold rent plus utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*). It's what you pay every month. The *Nebenkosten* are not a fixed cost; your landlord adjusts them once per year based on your usage.
- **Nothing is included**  
    Apartments usually come without a washing machine, curtains, light fixtures or a furnished kitchen (stove, fridge, sink). You must buy your own, or buy them from the previous tenant. In Berlin, apartments *must* include a stove and a sink,[^3] but not in the rest of Germany. [Furnished apartments](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) come with the kitchen, furniture and everything else.
- **You pay rent by bank transfer**  
    You usually pay the rent by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). You rarely pay the rent with cash, and never with cheques.
- **Rooms are not counted the same way**  
    In Germany, the living room also counts as a room. A studio is a *1 Zimmer Wohnung*. A 2-bedroom apartment with a living room is a *3 Zimmer Wohnung*. The kitchen, the bathroom and the hallway do not count as rooms.

[![Apartment floor plan berlin](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)

- **Floors are not counted the same way**  
    In North America, the first floor is the ground floor. In Germany, there is the ground floor (*Erdgeschoss* or *EG*), then the first floor.
- **The [TV tax](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag)**  
    Each household pays the TV tax (*[[Rundfunkbeitrag]]*). It costs {{RUNDFUNKBEITRAG_FEE}}€ per month. If you live with other people, you can split the cost. - [More information](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag)

## Your options

### Regular apartment

Regular apartments come unfurnished. You must buy your own fridge, washing machine, light fixtures, curtains and cookware. In Berlin, apartments must come with a stove and a sink.[^3]

You need more time to find a regular apartment, because there is more competition for them. You also need more time to move in, buy everything, get an internet connection, and get an electricity contract. It's a long-term investment.

A regular apartment is cheaper in the long term. Your rent is lower, because you don't rent the furniture with it.

**[Look for regular apartments ↓](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#step-1-look-for-apartments)**

### Furnished apartment

Furnished apartments are very expensive, but they have benefits:

- **Everything included**  
    You don't need to get an internet contract, an electricity contract, furniture, appliances or cookware. You can just move in, and focus on other problems.
- **Immigrant-friendly**  
    You can book an apartment before you arrive in Germany. They don't ask for documents that immigrants don't have, like a *[[Schufa]]*.
- **Less competition**  
    These apartments are too expensive for most people, so there is less competition for them. They are a little easier to find.

Furnished apartments are a good temporary solution while you look for a regular apartment. They are too expensive to live in permanently.

Some furnished apartments have a booking fee or a cleaning fee.[^4] If you rent for less than 6 months, you might pay 19% [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer).[^5]

**[Look for furnished apartments ↓](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#short-term-and-furnished-apartments)**

### Flatshare ([[WG]])

Sharing an apartment with other people is cheaper and easier:

- **Shared costs**  
    You can split the cost of rent, internet, electricity, [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag) and other bills. You save a lot of money.
- **Lower deposit**  
    Your [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) can't be more than 3 times your [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). Your part of the rent is lower, so your part of the deposit is also lower.
- **Many things included**  
    Your roommates might already have most of the things you need. You don't need to get an internet contract or an electricity contract.

Finding a [[WG]] is a little easier, but still very hard.[^6]

Usually, you must pass an interview with your roommates. Most WG interviews are like a personality test, but interviews for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* are more formal.

**[Look for flat shares ↓](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#wGs-flatshares-and-roommates)**

### Student housing

Student dorms are one of the cheapest options, but they are hard to get. Student housing has long waiting lists.

**[Look for student housing ↓](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#dorms-and-student-housing)**

### Buying an apartment

If you just moved to Berlin, don't buy an apartment. It's harder than finding an apartment to rent.

It's really hard to get a mortgage without EU citizenship or [permanent residency](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), and a steady job.

## Step 1: Look for apartments

### Ask your network

Ask the people you know: friends, colleagues, classmates... Many people find an apartment this way.

**If you already live in Berlin**, ask your *[[Hausverwaltung]]* if they have other apartments to rent. They prefer to rent to someone they trust. They can put you on a waiting list, and show you unlisted apartments.

**If you are in university**, your university has help clinics for new students, and boards where they put apartment listings.[^7]

### Real estate agents

People don't hire agents to find an apartment. They are mostly useless.[^10] They cost a lot of money, but they don't improve your chances. Many agents only accept clients with a high budget (over 3,000€ per month).

### Other tricks

- Install the [eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://themen.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/mobile-apps/) and [ImmoScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/mobile-services/) apps, and get notified of new apartment listings.
- Turn on push notifications for the Facebook housing groups you follow.

![Facebook group notifications 1](/images/facebook-group-notifications-1.png)

![Facebook group notifications 2](/images/facebook-group-notifications-2.png)

## Step 2: Choose apartments to visit

Most people can't choose where they live. They take what they find.[^11] You should look for a place you like, but you can't be too picky.

### How to choose an apartment

- **Is the price fair?**  
    The [ImmobilienScout24 rent atlas](https://atlas.immobilienscout24.de/) shows rent prices in the area. Furnished apartments are often much more expensive.
- **Can you register your address there?**  
    Always choose an apartment that lets you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). If you can't register your address, it makes your life harder. - [More information](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)
- **Should you live alone or in a WG?**  
    To save money, rent a room in a flat share (*[[WG]]*). It's cheaper, and the apartment already has internet, electricity, appliances and sometimes furniture. It saves you a lot of work.
- **What comes with the apartment?**  
    Apartments often come without appliances, curtains, and light fixtures. When an apartment is *mit [[Einbauküche]]*, it includes a stove, fridge and sometimes a dishwasher. You must buy your own washing machine. [[WG]]s and furnished apartments usually include everything you need.
- **Is the housing company good?**  
    Check which housing company (*[[Hausverwaltung]]*) owns the apartment. When you have a problem with your apartment, you must talk to them. Some housing companies are really bad.
- **Neubau or Altbau?**  
    New buildings (*Neubau*) are often quieter and better insulated. They have concrete walls and floors. You hear your neighbours less. Old buildings (*Altbau*) often have high ceilings, hardwood floors, and a lot more charm.
- **Which floor?**
    - **Top floor**   
        These apartments are quieter; you hear less traffic, and there is no neighbour above you. They get more sunlight. They are hotter in the summer,[^12] especially old apartments with bad insulation. Ask if they improved the insulation in the recent years. If you live in the attic (*Dachgeschoß*), the walls are at an angle, so the apartment can feel smaller.
    - **Upper floors**  
        These apartments get more sunlight. There is less traffic noise. Check if there is an elevator. It's harder to [move in](/guides/moving-in) without an elevator.
    - **Lower floors, ground floor**  
        Apartments on the lower floors are darker and louder. They are less safe because of break-ins. Neighbours can often see inside your apartment.[^13] Some ground floor apartments come with a garden.
- **Street or courtyard?**  
    Does the apartment face the street or the courtyard? On the street side, you hear the traffic more. On the courtyard side, you hear your other neighbours more. The courtyard side often gets less sun.
- **Balcony or not?**  
    A balcony is nice to have, especially if you work from home. Some apartments come with garden or rooftop access.
- **Storage and parking**  
    Many apartments come with a storage room in the basement (*Kellerraum*), and bicycle racks in the interior courtyard. Some buildings have parking spaces in the basement. A parking space in the basement garage usually costs around 120€ per month. Check if there is street parking.
- **Gas or electric?**  
    Some apartments have gas heating and gas stoves.

### How to choose a location

- **Neighbourhoods**  
    Berlin has a few popular neighbourhoods (*Kiez*): Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Neukölln, etc. These neighbourhoods are more interesting, but they are busier, louder and more expensive. There is a lot of competition for apartments in those areas. To save money or live in a quiet area, look for apartments outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*.
- **Crime**  
    Berlin is a safe city, even at night, but some parts are less safe. The areas next to big train stations (Alexanderplatz, Görlitzer Bahnhof, Kottbusser Tor, Hermannplatz) are more dangerous.[^14] There are more drunk people, drug addicts, street fights, vandalism and theft in those areas, but people will still leave you alone. You don't need to avoid the entire area, just the busy streets. Use the [crime atlas](https://www.kriminalitaetsatlas.berlin.de/K-Atlas/atlas.html) to find a safe area.
- **Noise**  
    Main roads are very noisy because of trams, cars and ambulances.[^15] Ambulances, trams and trains are *very* loud. You can hear even with your windows closed.[^16] Busy areas with lots of bars and restaurants are also loud, even late at night. Google Maps shows the busy areas in orange. If you want a quiet apartment, don't live in those areas. This old [noise map](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/laermkarte-berlin/) can help. The big red line is from Tegel airport, which closed in 2020.[^17]

![Berlin ambulance noise](/illustrations/berlin-ambulance-noise.png)

- **Public transportation**  
    Berlin has good public transportation. You can live far from the centre if you live close to a train or tram station. Use [Mapnificient](https://www.mapnificent.net/berlin/) to see how far you are from work.
- **Parking**  
    [You don't need a car in Berlin](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car-in-berlin). If you want a car, check if there is enough parking space nearby. In central neighbourhoods, parking spaces are harder to find, and you need a [parking permit](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany#parking). Your building might have a basement garage. Basement parking costs around 120€ per month. Single garages are harder to find. You can [park your motorcycle on the sidewalk](/guides/motorcycle-parking).
- **Parks and nature**  
    Berlin is one of the greenest cities in Europe.[^18] There are many parks and green spaces, even in the centre. To be closer to nature, live near [[Brandenburg]] or [Grunewald](https://goo.gl/maps/7bo9CKBKtQ8ysHB46).

[![Berlin busy areas](/images/berlin-busy-areas.png "In Google Maps, orange areas are interesting areas. They have good bars and restaurants, but they are busy and loud.")](/images/berlin-busy-areas.png)

[![Berlin tram lines](/images/berlin-tram-lines.png "If you live next to a tram line, you hear trams all day. They are very loud.")](/images/berlin-tram-lines.png)

### Common apartment scams

- **The lease is only for a few months**  
    Fixed-term leases are only valid in some situations.[^19] The lease must specify *why* it's fixed term, or the clause is invalid, and you can stay for as long as you want. This also applies to sublets, but not to student residences and vacation apartments. This is not always a scam; many landlords just don't know the law.
- **The lease says the apartment is furnished, but it's not true**  
    Rents are limited by the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]*, but that does not apply to furnished apartments. Landlords pretend that the apartment is furnished to charge more rent. [Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse) can help you reduce your rent.
- **The previous tenant wants to sell his furniture or his kitchen**  
    Sometimes, the previous tenant (*Vormieter*) wants to sell all their furniture or kitchen to you.[^20] If you don't take the furniture, you don't get the apartment. They often charge too much, because they know that someone will buy it to get the apartment.
- **You must pay a bribe**  
    The previous tenant or the landlord asks for a bribe to give you the apartment.[^21] This is illegal, but they know that someone will pay it.
- **The landlord is in another country**  
    This is a common scam.[^22] The landlord is not in Germany, but wants to mail the keys after you pay a [deposit](/guides/mietkaution). The apartment does not exist. They will steal your deposit money, and disappear.
- **Agent fees**  
    You never pay an agent fee ([*Maklergebühr*](/glossary/Provision) or *[[Provision]]*), unless *you* hired the agent.[^23] Furnished apartments often have a booking fee.[^24]
- **Identity theft**  
    The scammer creates fake apartment listings. When you apply for the apartment, you must send many documents, like a passport and a bank account statement. They use those documents you send to steal your identity.[^25]

Here are a few tricks to avoid scams:

- **Wait before you pay**  
    Don't send any money before you see the apartment in person and sign the lease.[^26] You have [until the day you move in](/guides/mietkaution#when-do-i-pay-the-kaution) to pay the rent and the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). You can [pay the deposit in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#pay-in-instalments). You never have to pay a fee to see an apartment, or to apply for it.[^42]
- **Wait before you send documents**  
    Don't send your pay slips, your *[[Steuerbescheid]]* or a copy of your passport before you see the apartment. You don't need to share these documents to visit an apartment, only to apply for it. You should censor the parts of the documents that they don't need to see.
- **Only pay by bank transfer**  
    In Germany, people pay their rent by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). Never send money by Western Union or other payment services.[^27] If you pay with cash, ask for a receipt. Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from another country. You have until the day you [move in](/guides/moving-in) to pay the rent and the deposit, so you can also come to Germany, [open a bank account](/guides/german-banks-no-address), then pay your rent.
- **Use common sense**  
    If the rent is too low, it's probably a scam.[^28] There are no cheap furnished apartments in the centre. If it's too easy to get the apartment, it's probably a scam.
- **Look at the account age**  
    Scammers often use a new account to publish apartment listings. If the account is only a few days old, be careful.
- **Use Google**  
    Search the landlord's name and [[IBAN]] on Google. You can also search for parts of their messages on Google.[^29] If they are a scammer, you might find some warnings online, or identical ads with different photos. If the IBAN does not start with "DE", be careful.
- **Use Google Street View**  
    Scammers often use photos of a different apartment. Use [reverse image search](https://tineye.com/) to see if the photos come from another listing. Check if the apartment looks the same on the photos and on Google Street View. Is the balcony the same? Are the windows the same shape?

## Step 3: Contact the landlord

After you find apartments you like, contact the landlord now. Here are ways to improve your chances:

- **Speak or write in German**  
    You get more responses if you use German.
- **Call and write**  
    Some landlords only answer phone calls. Others only answer emails. Call as soon as you can, then send a message.
- **Introduce yourself**  
    When you contact the landlord, include all the important details about you: your name, age, job, salary, when you want to move in, who will live with you, what documents you have,[^30] and a personal introduction. A cover letter and a photo can help.[^31] Use [example messages](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/artikel/accommodation-search-example-of-a-successful-flat-application) to write your message. [Lingoking](/out/lingoking-letters) can translate your message and cover letter to German.
- **Send many applications**  
    You must apply for dozens of apartments, not just one or two. It's not enough. Some people send hundreds of applications before they find an apartment.
- **Be prepared**  
    Landlords get hundreds of messages and dozens of applications *per day*. Make their life as easy as possible. Fill the application form in advance, and bring all the required documents with you.
- **Be flexible**  
    There are really nice apartments outside of Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain or Neukölln. Search in all of Berlin, including outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*. Berlin has good public transportation; you don't need to live in the center.
- **Be first**  
    If you find an apartment you like, act fast. Contact the landlord now.[^32] They get hundreds of message a day, so you can't wait. If you get ImmobilienScout24 Premium, you see the ads before others, and your messages go to the top of the list.[^33]

### What landlords want

Landlords prefer quiet, long-term tenants who pay their rent on time. They want to avoid problems.

Landlords want tenants with...

- **A good income**  
    Your rent should be less than 30% of your monthly [*Netto* income](/glossary/Netto%20income).[^34] Many landlords ask for this. Two incomes are better than one. If you have a good salary, include it in your introduction messages. If you make a lot of money, you can apply for more expensive apartments. There is less competition for those apartments.
- **A stable job**  
    Landlords prefer tenants with a stable job. It's harder to find an apartment if you are self-employed, or if you are on your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit). If you have a good job, include it in your introduction messages.
- **A stable residence permit**  
    It's easier to find an apartment if you have a EU citizenship, or a stable [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). It's very hard to find an apartment if you are in another country. If you are not yet in Germany, try finding a [temporary furnished apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#short-term-and-furnished-apartments).
- **German speakers**  
    If you speak German, it's easier to find an apartment. It's less work for the landlord. It's another good reason to [learn German](/guides/learn-german).
- **No dogs, no pets**
    Landlords prefer people without pets. It's harder to find an apartment when you have a dog. Only 20% of apartments explicitly allow pets. Some websites let you filter for apartments that allow pets.
- **No foreign names**  
    People with foreign names get rejected more often.[^35] If you apply as a couple, let the person with the most German name apply for the apartment. You will get more responses.[^36]

## Step 4: Visit the apartment

The landlord will invite you to visit the apartment (the *Besichtigung*). You can usually apply for the apartment during your visit.

### What to bring to the visit

If you want to get the apartment, come prepared. Bring all your documents with you. If you like the apartment, you can apply during the visit.

![Berlin apartment documents](/illustrations/berlin-apartment-documents.png)

You must send personal documents to people you have never met. Some scammers pretend to be landlords. They create fake listings to get your documents and steal your identity.[^25]

Only send documents after you see the apartment.

Remove bank account numbers, passport numbers and [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer)s from your documents. The safest way to censor a document is to print it, censor it with a pen, and scan it again.

You need these documents to apply for an apartment:

- **[[Schufa]] report**  
    This is like a credit report. You can [get one for free](/guides/free-schufa-berlin). If you are new in Germany, your *[[Schufa]]* is empty. You can bring a work contract or a tax return, to prove that you make enough money. Furnished apartments from [Homelike](/out/homelike), [Spotahome](/out/spotahome), [Wunderflats](/out/wunderflats) don't ask for a Schufa.[^37]
- **Passport or personal ID**  
    You must show it when you apply for the apartment. Bring photocopies of your ID, just in case.
- **Proof of income**  
    Bring a work contract, your last 3 pay slips, or your last *[[Steuerbescheid]]*. If you are a freelancer, bring a [profit-and-loss statement](/glossary/Ertragsvorschau). If you don't make enough money, you can get a *[[Mietbürgschaft]]*.
- **Bank account statement** (optional)  
    This shows how much money you have in your bank account. If you are a freelancer, bring one.[^38]
- **Employment contract** (optional)  
    Some landlords want to see your employment contract.[^39] It proves that you have a stable income. It's harder to find an apartment during your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit).
- **[[Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung]]** (optional)  
    This document proves that you don't owe money to your previous landlord. You get it from your previous landlord. It does not have a standard format, but you can use [this template](/documents/Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung-muster.pdf).
- **[[Mietbürgschaft]]** (optional)  
    If you don't have a stable income, a parent or a friend can be your guarantor. If you don't pay the rent on time, your guarantor must pay it for you. This is a good option for students, freelancers and people with a low income. Use [this *Mietbürgschaft* template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyhRVDPmmzkER5ElnPSlAR3J5ohw2j32/view).
- **Application form** (optional)  
    If an agency listed the apartment, download their application form and fill it in advance. If you like the apartment you visit, you can apply immediately. You can usually find the application form on their website.
- **Copies of everything**

### What to look for?

- **Appliances**  
    Check what appliances fit in the apartment. Do you need a smaller washing machine? Is there room for a dishwasher? Does your bed fit in the bedroom?
- **Hausordnung**  
    Each building has different house rules (*[[Hausordnung]]*). For example, some buildings have [quiet hours](/guides/quiet-hours) from 13:00 to 16:00.[^40] The *Hausordnung* often has rules about quiet hours, BBQs, ventilation, musical instruments, vehicles and pets.
- **Neighbours**  
    Check who your neighbours are. For example, if they have pets and children, you will sometimes hear them. If you visit the apartment during the day, it can be quieter than in the evening, when all your neighbours are at home.
- **Noise**  
    Can you hear the noise outside? Traffic, ambulances, bars and other noise can be a problem.
- **Pets**  
    Are pets allowed in this apartment? Most apartment listings show this information.
- **Internet access**  
    Some buildings can't get a fast internet connection. Use [this tool](https://www.check24.de/dsl/verfuegbarkeit/) to see what internet options are available there.

### Visiting a flat share

If you visit a *[[WG]]*, the process is different. It's not a visit, but an interview. You meet your future roommates, and they decide if they like you.[^41] These interviews can be very informal: you might meet to have a drink or even play board games together. This takes a lot of your time.

The interview for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* is usually shorter. Your roommate wants to save money. They don't care so much about being your friend.

## Step 5: Sign the lease, pay the deposit

After you sign the lease (*Mietvertrag*), the apartment is yours. You signed a contract. You can't change your mind. Next, you must pay the rent and the [deposit](/guides/mietkaution). You have until your move in date to pay. Do not send any money before you sign the lease and see the apartment. If you pay with cash, always ask for a receipt.

**[How to pay the deposit ➞](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution)**

After you sign the lease, you will receive 3 important documents:

1. The signed lease - You need this for your *[[Anmeldung]]*, and to apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).
2. The *[[Übergabeprotokoll]]* - You get this document after you get the apartment keys.
3. The*[ Wohnungsgeberbestätigung](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbest%C3%A4tigung)* - You need this for your *[[Anmeldung]]*

## Step 6: Move in

After you find a place, you must leave the old apartment, and move into the new apartment.

**[How to move out of an apartment ➞](/guides/moving-out)**

**[How to move into an apartment ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

You must register your address, put your name on the mailbox, and change your address.

You might need to [buy furniture, appliances, etc](/guides/where-to-buy-what). You must also learn [how to sort your trash](/guides/sorting-trash-in-germany), [how your electric bill works](/guides/electric-bill-berlin), and [what to do if you lose your keys](/guides/lost-keys).

You should also get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) and join a [tenants' association](/glossary/Mieterverein).
