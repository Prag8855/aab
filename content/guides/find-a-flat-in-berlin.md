## Is it hard to find an apartment?

**Yes, it's really hard**. It can take months and hundreds of applications.[^0] It's much harder for recent immigrants. It's one of the hardest parts of [moving to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin). You might live in many temporary places before you find a home.[^23] It can be hard on your mental health.[^2]

**[What landlords want ↓](#what-landlords-want)**

## Before you start

Before you [look for apartments](#step-1-look-for-apartments), you should...

- [ ] **Understand [how things work](#important-knowledge) in Germany**  
    Things are different in Germany. Learn about those small differences.
- [ ] **Know [your options](#your-housing-options)**  
    Your options depend on your situation. Don't waste time on apartments that you won't get.
- [ ] **Save money**  
    You need enough money for the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) and the first rent. In total, you need around 4 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You must also [buy furniture, appliances, and house supplies](/guides/where-to-buy-what#furniture-and-house-supplies).
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**  
    Germans pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). If you don't have a EU bank account, use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to send money from another country.
- [ ] **Create accounts on housing websites**  
    Create detailed profiles on [ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/), [Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/) and [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/). You will need them to apply for apartments. A detailed profile improves your chances.[^27]
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    To find an apartment, you have to be fast. You must have your documents ready.

## Step 1: Look for apartments

### Ask everyone

- **People you know**  
    Tell your friends, family, colleagues and classmates that you need a place to live. People often find an apartment like this.[^21]
- **Your [[Hausverwaltung]]**  
    Landlords prefer people they already know. They might give you priority when they have an apartment for rent.
- **Your university**  
    Universities have boards with apartment listings, and help clinics for new students.[^7]

### Apartment search websites

- **[ImmobilienScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/)**  
    The main housing website. You should pay for the premium account.[^1]
- **[Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de:443/)** - Biggest classified ads site
- **[Immowelt](https://www.immowelt.de/)** - Second biggest apartment listing site

### Real estate agents

An agent (*[[Makler]]*) can help you find an apartment. Some are really good, and some are useless. Their maximum fee is 2 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete), plus [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer). If you did not hire the agent, don't pay an agent fee; [it's a scam](/guides/housing-scams#agent-fees).

### Bots and automation

To get an apartment, you must be fast. Tools help you find apartments and message landlords first.

- **Apartment bots**  
    Use the [Hypofriend apartment bot](https://hypofriend.de/en/lp/immofriend), [@berlinflatsbot](https://t.me/berlinflatsbot) and [Flathunters](https://flathunter.codders.io/).
- **Alerts and notifications**  
    Install the [Kleinanzeigen](https://themen.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/mobile-apps/) and [ImmoScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/mobile-services/) apps, and create alerts for new apartment listings.[^44] Turn on push notifications for the Facebook groups you follow.

![Facebook group notifications 1](/images/facebook-group-notifications-1.png)

![Facebook group notifications 2](/images/facebook-group-notifications-2.png)

## Step 2: Choose apartments to visit

In Berlin, **you can't be picky**, but you can be careful. If you choose the wrong place, it hurts for a long time.

### Apartment checklist

- [ ] **[Is it a scam?](/guides/housing-scams)**
- [ ] **Is the price fair?**  
    The [ImmobilienScout24 rent atlas](https://atlas.immobilienscout24.de/) shows rent prices in the area. Furnished apartments are often much more expensive.
- [ ] **Can you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) there?**  
    Always choose an apartment that lets you do your *[[Anmeldung]]*. [It's very important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address), especially for recent immigrants.
- [ ] **Is the lease unlimited?**  
    Look for an unlimited (*unbefristet*) contract. A short-term lease means that you must move again in a few months. [Short-term leases are often illegal](/guides/housing-scams#temporary-leases).
- [ ] **What is included?**  
    Most apartments come with nothing. No kitchen, appliances, curtains or light fixtures. You must buy and install everything. [[WG]]s usually come with most of those things. Furnished apartments are overpriced. Apartments *mit [[Einbauküche]]* include a stove, a fridge and sometimes a dishwasher.
- [ ] **How is the housing company?**  
    Search the name of your landlord or housing company (*[[Hausverwaltung]]*). Some are really bad.
- [ ] **Neubau or Altbau?**  
    New buildings (*Neubau*) are often quieter and better insulated. They have concrete walls and floors. You hear your neighbours less. Old buildings (*Altbau*) often look nicer: high ceilings, hardwood floors, and a lot more charm.
- [ ] **Which floor?**
    - **Top floor**  
        These apartments are quieter; you hear less traffic, and there is no neighbour above you. They get more sunlight. They are hotter in the summer, especially old apartments with bad insulation.[^12] Ask if they improved the insulation in the recent years. If you live in the attic (*Dachgeschoß*), the walls are at an angle, so the apartment can feel smaller.
    - **Upper floors**  
        These apartments get more sunlight. There is less traffic noise. Check if there is an elevator.
    - **Lower floors, ground floor**  
        Lower floors are darker and louder. Break-ins can happen. Neighbours can see inside your apartment.[^13] Some ground floor apartments have a garden.
- [ ] **Street or courtyard?**  
    Which side is the apartment on? On the street side, you hear traffic more. On the courtyard side, you hear other neighbours more. The courtyard side gets less sun.
- [ ] **Storage and parking**  
    Is there a rack for your bicycle? A storage room in the basement (*Kellerraum*)? Is street parking easy to find? Is there a parking space in the basement? How much does it cost?

### Location checklist

- **Neighbourhood**  
    Berlin has a few popular neighbourhoods (*Kiez*): Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Neukölln, etc. These neighbourhoods are more interesting, but they are busier, louder and more expensive. There is a lot of competition for apartments in those areas. To save money or live in a quiet area, look for apartments outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*.
- **Public transit connections and commute time**  
    Berlin has good public transportation. You can live far from the centre if you live close to a train or tram station. Use [Mapnificient](https://www.mapnificent.net/berlin/) to see how far you are from work.
- **Crime**  
    Berlin is a safe city, even at night, but some parts are less safe. The areas next to big train stations (Alexanderplatz, Görlitzer Bahnhof, Kottbusser Tor, Hermannplatz) are more dangerous.[^14] There are more drunk people, drug addicts, street fights, vandalism and theft in those areas, but people will still leave you alone. You don't need to avoid the entire area, just the busy streets. Use the [crime atlas](https://www.kriminalitaetsatlas.berlin.de/K-Atlas/atlas.html) to find a safe area.
- **Noise**  
    Main roads are very noisy because of trams, cars and ambulances.[^15] Ambulances, trams and trains are *very* loud. You can hear even with your windows closed.[^16] Busy areas with lots of bars and restaurants are also loud, even late at night. Google Maps shows the busy areas in orange. If you want a quiet apartment, don't live in those areas. The [noise map](https://www.berlin.de/umweltatlas/verkehr-laerm/laermbelastung/2022/karten/artikel.1305256.php) can help. The big red line is from Tegel airport, which closed in 2020.[^17]

![Berlin ambulance noise](/illustrations/berlin-ambulance-noise.png)

- **Parking**  
    [You don't need a car in Berlin](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car). If you want a car, check if there is enough parking space nearby. In central neighbourhoods, parking spaces are harder to find, and you need a [parking permit](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany#parking). Your building might have a basement garage. Basement parking costs around 120€ per month. Single garages are harder to find. You can [park your motorcycle on the sidewalk](/guides/motorcycle-parking).
- **Parks and nature**  
    Berlin is one of the greenest cities in Europe.[^18] There are many parks and green spaces, even in the centre. To be closer to nature, live near [[Brandenburg]] or [Grunewald](https://goo.gl/maps/7bo9CKBKtQ8ysHB46).

### Common apartment scams

**[Common housing scams ➞](/guides/housing-scams)**

## Step 3: Contact the landlord

When you find an apartment you like, contact the landlord. **Do not wait.** The landlord gets hundreds of messages in the first hour.[^22] Most listings disappear after a few minutes.[^26]

Write to the landlord in German, not in English. In your message, include...[^30]

- [ ] ⭐️ Your occupation
- [ ] ⭐️ Your salary
- [ ] Your name (and doctor title)
- [ ] Your age
- [ ] Your residence status
- [ ] When you want to move in
- [ ] Who will move in with you
- [ ] A personal introduction
- [ ] A photo of you (optional, but it helps)[^31]

If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to translate your message.

**[Example messages](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/artikel/accommodation-search-example-of-a-successful-flat-application)** - WG-Gesucht

To improve your chances...

- **Be really fast**  
    Listings only stay online for a few minutes. Landlords get hundreds of messages per hour. Pay for ImmobilienScout24 Premium; it lets you message landlords first.[^33] Push notifications, bots and message templates help.
- **Send a lot of messages**  
    You might need to send hundreds of messages. Searching for an apartment is a full time job.
- **Be prepared**  
    Prepare all the [required documents](#required-documents) in advance. Be ready to send them quickly.
- **Write and call**  
    Most landlords prefer emails, but some prefer calls.[^35] Try both.
- **Have a detailed profile**  
    Create a detailed profile on ImmobilienScout24 and other websites. When you message a landlord, include all the important information.
- **Don't be picky**  
    You probably won't get a cheap apartment in a good neighbourhood. Be ready to choose a less-than-perfect apartment. If you are a recent immigrant, be ready to accept anything.

### What landlords want

Landlords want stability. They want quiet tenants who pay the rent on time.

In order, they prefer...[^32]

- Couples without children 👍👍👍
- Singles without children 👍👍
- Families with children 👍
- Retirees 👎
- Students 👎👎
- Single parents 👎👎
- [Flatshares](/glossary/WG) 👎👎👎

Landlords prefer...

- **A good income**  
    Your rent should be 20% to 40% of your monthly [[Netto income]].[^34] Your income can't be too low or too high.[^48] Two incomes are better than one.
- **A stable job**  
    If you are self-employed, it's much harder to find an apartment. If you are unemployed, it's impossible. If you are in your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), it's a little harder.[^36]
- **A good first impression**  
    Personal impression is very important.[^29] Your personality matters in your messages and during your apartment visit. Be nice and pleasant.
- **A stable right of residence**  
    You must have a long-term right to live in Germany. If you have a [[National Visa]], it's harder to find an apartment. If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa) or no visa, it's *much* harder. You can get a [short-term furnished apartment](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) or a room in a [[WG]].
- **German speakers**  
    If you speak German, it's less work for the landlord.
- **Titles**  
    Landlords prefer doctors and professors.[^10] Use your title when you write to the landlord.

Landlords often avoid...

- **Recent immigrants**  
    Landlords want stable tenants. Recent immigrants are more likely to lose their job, lose their residence permit or move away. Discrimination is also a problem.[^9] Some landlords *prefer* immigrants because they pay more and don't know their rights.[^25]
- **Parents**  
    Landlords prefer couples, then singles, then families.[^29]
- **Students**  
    Most landlords avoid students
- **Dog owners**  
    When you have a dog, it's much harder to find an apartment. - [Advice for dog owners](/guides/dog-ownership#finding-an-apartment-with-a-dog)
- **People who know their rights**  
    Landlords avoid people who know the rules too well, like lawyers and government employees.[^24]

## Step 4: Visit the apartment

If you are lucky, the landlord will invite you to see the apartment. Arrive early and bring all the required documents. It might be a private visit (just you), or an open visit (many other people).

Do not go to mass viewings with more than 40 people. They are a waste of time.[^20]

You can usually apply for the apartment during your visit. Bring all the [required documents](#required-documents) to [apply for the apartment](#step-5-apply-for-the-apartment).

### What to look for

- **Appliances**  
    Check what appliances fit in the apartment. Do you need a smaller washing machine? Is there room for a dishwasher? Does your bed fit in the bedroom?
- **Hausordnung**  
    Each building has different house rules (*[[Hausordnung]]*). For example, some buildings have [quiet hours](/guides/quiet-hours) from 13:00 to 16:00.[^40] The *Hausordnung* often has rules about quiet hours, BBQs, ventilation, musical instruments, vehicles and pets.
- **Neighbours**  
    Check who your neighbours are. For example, if they have pets and children, you will sometimes hear them. If you visit the apartment during the day, it can be quieter than in the evening, when all your neighbours are at home.
- **Noise**  
    How is the soundproofing? Can you hear the neighbours? Can you hear the noise outside? Traffic, ambulances, bars and other noise can be a problem.
- **Pets**  
    Are pets allowed in this apartment? Most apartment listings show this information.
- **Internet access**  
    Some buildings can't get a fast internet connection. Use [this tool](https://www.check24.de/dsl/verfuegbarkeit/) to see if you can get fast internet there.

### Visiting a flat share

*[[WG]]* visits are more like an interview. You meet your future roommates, and they decide if they like you.[^41] Some interviews are very informal: you might meet to have a drink or even play board games together.

The interview for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* is usually shorter. Your roommate wants to save money. They don't care so much about being your friend.

### How to behave during the visit

- **Dress well**  
    A clean appearance makes a good impression. You don't need a suit, just clean clothes, clean shoes, and socks without holes.[^11]
- **Be on time**  
    Arrive a little early. If you are late, message the landlord.[^28]
- **Be pleasant**  
    Be friendly and polite. Greet the landlord or the agent. Use German if you can.
- **Don't complain**  
    If you start finding problems with the apartment, you look like you will be a difficult tenant.
- **Don't negotiate**  
    The rent is not negotiable. There are dozens of other candidates. The price will not go down.

## Step 5: Apply for the apartment

### Required documents

To get the apartment, **come prepared**. Bring a copy of all your documents with you. If you like the apartment, you can apply during the visit.

![Berlin apartment documents](/illustrations/berlin-apartment-documents.png)

Bring these documents with you:[^19]

- [ ] **[[Schufa]] report**  
    This is like a credit report. You can [get one for free](/guides/schufa). If you are new in Germany, your *[[Schufa]]* is empty. You can bring a work contract or a tax return, to prove that you make enough money. Furnished apartments from [Homelike](/out/homelike), [Spotahome](/out/spotahome), [Wunderflats](/out/wunderflats) don't ask for a Schufa.[^37]
- [ ] **Passport or [[Personalausweis]]**  
    You must prove your identity if you apply for the apartment.
- [ ] **Proof of income**  
    There are many ways to prove your income:
    - [ ] Work contract
    - [ ] Last 3 payslips
    - [ ] Last [tax statement](/glossary/Steuerbescheid)
    - [ ] Bank account statement (if self-employed)[^38]
    - [ ] Profit and loss statement (if self-employed)
- [ ] **[[Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung]]** (optional)  
    This document proves that you don't owe money to your previous landlord. You get it from your previous landlord. It does not have a standard format, but you can use [this template](/documents/Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung-muster.pdf). You can also use bank statements to show that you pay rent every month.[^47]
- [ ] **[[Mietbürgschaft]]** (optional)  
    If you have a low or unstable income, someone can be your guarantor. If you don't pay the rent, they must pay it for you. It's useful for students and freelancers. Use [this *Mietbürgschaft* template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyhRVDPmmzkER5ElnPSlAR3J5ohw2j32/view).
- [ ] **Application form**  
    If an agency listed the apartment, download their application form and fill it in advance. If you like the apartment you visit, you can apply immediately. You can usually find the application form on their website.
- [ ] **Copies of everything**  
    Give copies to the landlord, keep the originals.

You must send your personal documents to people you don't know. Identity theft is a big risk. To protect yourself, [censor your documents](/guides/housing-scams#censor-your-documents).

**Combine your documents** into one PDF. Landlords prefer that.[^42] Use a [PDF merging tool](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html).

## Step 6: Sign the lease and move in

You will sign a lease, pay the deposit, get the keys and move in. You must register your address, put your name on the mailbox, and change your address.

**[How to move out ➞](/guides/moving-out)**

**[How to move in ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

## Important knowledge

### Deposit

Almost all apartments require a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). It's usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You get it back when you [move out](/guides/moving-out). You can [pay it in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You must pay the first instalment before you [move in](/guides/moving-in).

**[How the deposit works ➞](/guides/mietkaution)**

### Cold rent and warm rent

The warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*) is what you pay every month. It's the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) plus utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*).

The *Nebenkosten* usually include:

- Heating
- Hot water (most of the time)
- Trash collection
- Cleaning and landscaping

The *Nebenkosten* are not a fixed cost, because you don't know how much water and heating you really use. Your landlord adjusts the *Nebenkosten* every year based on your usage. You pay what your landlord pays. Your landlord can't make a profit on *Nebenkosten*.

### Nothing is included

Apartments usually come without a washing machine, curtains, light fixtures or a furnished kitchen (stove, fridge, sink). You must buy your own, or buy them from the previous tenant. In Berlin, apartments *must* include a stove and a sink,[^3] but not in the rest of Germany.

[Furnished apartments](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) come with the kitchen, furniture and everything you need, but they are expensive.

### Rent is paid by bank transfer

You usually pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). You rarely pay the rent with cash, and never with cheques.

You need a European bank account to make bank transfers. You can also use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from a non-EU country.

### Rooms and floors

Rooms and floors are not counted the same way everywhere.

In Germany, the living room also counts as a room. A studio is a *1 Zimmer Wohnung*. A 2-bedroom apartment with a living room is a *3 Zimmer Wohnung*. The kitchen, the bathroom and the hallway do not count as rooms.

[![Apartment floor plan berlin](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)

In many countries, the first floor is the ground floor. In Germany, the first floor is above the ground floor.

[![Floors/stories of a German building](/images/building-floors.jpg)](/images/building-floors.jpg)

## Your housing options

### Regular apartment

Regular apartments come without furniture, appliances, light fixtures, curtains or cookware. They are empty. In Berlin, apartments must come with a stove and a sink.[^3] You must buy everything else yourself. You must also get an internet connection and find an electricity company.

Regular apartments are a good **long-term solution**, because they are cheaper. There is a lot of competition for those apartments, so they are hard to find.

A regular apartment is cheaper in the long term. Your rent is lower, because you don't rent the furniture with it.

**[Look for regular apartments ↓](#step-1-look-for-apartments)**

### Short-term, furnished apartment

Short-term apartments are very expensive, but they come with everything you need. They are a good **short-term solution** when you [move to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin).

Short-term apartments have many benefits:

- **Fully furnished**  
    They come with everything you need: furniture, appliances and cookware. You don't need to get an internet contract, an electricity contract, furniture, appliances or cookware. 
- **Internet and utilities included**  
    The internet and utilities are already connected. You can just move in, and focus on other problems.
- **Immigrant-friendly**  
    You can book an apartment before you arrive in Germany. They don't ask for documents that immigrants don't have, like a *[[Schufa]]*.
- **Less competition**  
    These apartments are overpriced, and too expensive for most people. There is less competition for them, so they are a little easier to find.

Some furnished apartments have a booking fee or a cleaning fee.[^4] If you rent for less than 6 months, you might pay {{ VAT_RATE }}% [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) (included in the price).[^5]

### Flat share ([[WG]])

Sharing an apartment with other people is cheaper and easier. They are a **budget-friendly solution**.

Shared apartments have many benefits:

- **Shared costs**  
    You can split the cost of rent, internet, electricity, [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag) and other bills. You save a lot of money.
- **Lower deposit**  
    Your part of the rent is lower, so your part of the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) is also lower. If you don't have a lot of savings, a [[WG]] could be your only option.
- **Many things included**  
    Your roommates might already have most of the furniture and cookware you need. You don't need to buy everything yourself. The internet and utilities are already connected.

Finding a [[WG]] is a little easier than finding a full apartment, but still very hard.[^6]

Usually, you must meet your roommates for an interview. Most WG interviews are like a personality test or culture fit test. Interviews for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* are more formal.

### Student housing

Student dorms are the **cheapest option for students**, but they are hard to get. Student housing has long waiting lists.

There is also luxury student housing. It's very expensive, but it comes with everything you need.

**[Look for student housing ↓](#dorms-and-student-housing)**

### Buying an apartment

If you just moved to Berlin, **don't buy an apartment**. Buying is even harder than renting. If you just started a new job, you won't get a mortgage. If you don't have EU citizenship or [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you won't get a mortgage.
