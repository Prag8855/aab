## Is it hard to find an apartment?

**Yes, it's really hard**. It's one of the hardest parts of [moving to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin). It can take months and hundreds of messages.[^0] It's much harder for recent immigrants. You might need to live in temporary places until you find a home. It can be hard on your mental health.

If you are not in Berlin yet, it's almost impossible to find an apartment. [Short-term housing](#short-term-furnished-apartment) might be your only option.

**[Your housing options ↓](#your-housing-options)**

## Before you start

Before you [look for apartments](#look-for-apartments), you must...

- [ ] **Know [your options](#your-housing-options)**  
    Don't waste time on apartments that you can't get. If you are new in Berlin, your have fewer housing options. If you are not yet in Berlin, a [short-term apartment](#short-term-furnished-apartment) might be your only option.
- [ ] **Save money**  
    You need enough money for the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) and the first month of rent. You must also buy furniture, appliances, and house supplies.
- [ ] **Understand [how housing works](#important-knowledge) in Germany**  
    If you are new in Germany, there are little differences that you must know about.
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**  
    Germans pay rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung), so you need a bank account. You can also transfer money from another country with [Wise](/out/transferwise).
- [ ] **Create accounts on housing websites**  
    Create [ImmoScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/), [Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/) and [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/) profiles. A detailed profile improves your chances.[^27]
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    To apply get the apartment, you must be fast. Your documents must be ready.

## 1. Look for apartments

### Ask everyone

People often find an apartment through friends.[^21] Most apartments are never listed online.

- **Tell everyone you know**  
    Ask you friends, family, colleagues and classmates to help you find a place.
- **Ask your [[Hausverwaltung]]**  
    They might have other apartments. They might put you on a waiting list.

    They have help clinics and a board with apartment listings.[^7] Join the waiting list for [student housing](#student-housing).

### Real estate agents

An agent (*[[Makler]]*) can help you find an apartment. Some are really good, and some are useless. They are hard to find.[^23] Their maximum fee is 2 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete), plus [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer). If you did not hire the agent, don't pay an agent fee; [it's a scam](/guides/housing-scams#agent-fees).

- **[BerlinRelo](https://www.berlinrelo.de/)** - Graham is really good at his job. He accepts a small number of customers, and guarantees results.
- [Move to Berlin Relocation](https://www.moveto-berlin.com/en/home-search-2/) 
- [HomeSK](https://www.homesk.de/Search) - Very expensive

### Bots and automation

To get an apartment, you must be fast. Tools help you find apartments and message landlords first.

- **Apartment bots**  
    Use the [Hypofriend apartment bot](https://hypofriend.de/en/lp/immofriend), [@berlinflatsbot](https://t.me/berlinflatsbot) and [Flathunters](https://flathunter.codders.io/). You get a notification when there are new apartments.
- **Automatic messaging**  
    [Get The Flat](https://gettheflat.com/) automatically writes to the landlord when it finds apartments that fit your needs. It's expensive.
- **Alerts and push notifications**  
    Install the [Kleinanzeigen](https://themen.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/mobile-apps/) and [ImmoScout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/mobile-services/) apps, and create alerts for new apartment listings.[^44] Turn on push notifications for the Facebook groups you follow.

![Facebook group notifications 2](/images/facebook-group-notifications-2.png)

## 2. Choose apartments to visit

In Berlin, **you can't be picky**, but you can be careful. If you choose the wrong place, it hurts for a long time.

### Apartment checklist

- [ ] **[Is it a scam?](/guides/housing-scams)**
- [ ] **Is the price fair?**  
    The [ImmoScout24 rent atlas](https://atlas.immobilienscout24.de/) shows rent prices in the area. Furnished apartments are much more expensive. If you can't afford the rent, the [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde) can reject your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.[^2] If the price is too low, it might be a scam.
- [ ] **Can you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) there?**  
    Choose an apartment where you can do your *[[Anmeldung]]*. [It's very important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address), especially for recent immigrants.
- [ ] **Is the lease unlimited?**  
    Look for an unlimited (*unbefristet*) contract. A short-term lease means that you must move again in a few months. [Short-term leases are often illegal](/guides/housing-scams#temporary-leases).
- [ ] **What is included?**  
    Most apartments come empty. No furniture, appliances, curtains or light fixtures. [[WG]]s might come with most of what you need. Furnished apartments come with everything, but they are expensive.
    - **Electricity**  
        Is hot water included in your warm rent? If the building has central water heating, it's usually included in your *[[Nebenkosten]]*. If the apartment has a [tankless water heater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankless_water_heating) (*Durchlauferhitzer*), hot water is not included.[^3] Your *Nebenkosten* are lower, but your electric bills are higher.
    - **Kitchen**  
        Is the kitchen (counter, sink, stove, fridge) included? Apartments *mit [[Einbauküche]]* include a kitchen. Sometimes, you must buy the kitchen from the previous tenant at a ridiculous price. [It's a common scam.](/guides/housing-scams#buy-the-furniture-to-get-the-flat)
- [ ] **How is the housing company?**  
    Search for reviews of your landlord or housing company (*[[Hausverwaltung]]*). It could be a really bad landlord or a [housing scam](/guides/housing-scams).
- [ ] **Neubau or Altbau?**  
    New buildings (*Neubau*) are usually quieter and better insulated. They have concrete walls and floors. Old buildings (*Altbau*) have more charm with their high ceilings and hardwood floors.
- [ ] **Which floor?**
    - **Top floor apartments** are quieter; you hear traffic less, and there are no neighbours above you. They get more sunlight, but they are hotter in the summer, especially old apartments with bad insulation.[^12] Ask if they improved the insulation in the recent years. Attic apartments (*Dachgeschosswohnung*) feel smaller because of [angled walls and wooden beams](/images/dachgeschosswohnung-berlin.jpg).
    - **Upper floor apartments** get more sunlight. There is less traffic noise. Check if there is an elevator.
    - **Lower floors and ground floor appartments** are darker and louder. Break-ins can happen. Neighbours can see inside your apartment.[^13] Some ground floor apartments have a garden.
- [ ] **Street or courtyard?**  
    Which side is the apartment on? On the street side, you hear traffic more. On the courtyard side, you hear other neighbours more. The courtyard side gets less sun.
- [ ] **Storage and parking**  
    Is there a place for your bicycle? A storage room in the basement (*Kellerraum*)? How much does a parking space cost? Is there street parking?
- [ ] **Do you need a [WBS](/glossary/Wohnberechtigungsschein)?**  
    Some apartments require a *[[Wohnberechtigungsschein]]*. If you don't have one, you can't live there.
- [ ] **Internet access**  
    Some buildings can't get a fast internet connection. Use [this tool](https://www.check24.de/dsl/verfuegbarkeit/) to see your internet options.
- [ ] **Pets**  
    Are pets allowed? Cats are usually allowed, but not dogs.
- [ ] **Amenities**  
    In general, German apartment buildings don't have a pool or a gym. Some might have a shared garden or bicycle storage.

### Location checklist

- [ ] **Neighbourhood**  
    Berlin has a few popular neighbourhoods (*Kiez*): Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Neukölln, etc. These neighbourhoods are more interesting, but they are busier, louder and more expensive. There is a lot of competition for apartments in those areas. To save money or live in a quiet area, look for apartments outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*.
- [ ] **Public transit access**  
    How is the train or tram connection? Use [Mapnificient](https://www.mapnificent.net/berlin/) and Google Maps to see how far you are from work.
- [ ] **Crime**  
    Use the [crime atlas](https://www.kriminalitaetsatlas.berlin.de/K-Atlas/atlas.html) to find a safe area. Areas next to big train stations (Alexanderplatz, Görlitzer Bahnhof, Kottbusser Tor, Hermannplatz) are more dangerous.[^14] There are more drunk people, drug addicts, street fights, vandalism and theft in those areas. You don't need to avoid the entire area, just the busy streets.
- [ ] **Parking**  
    [You don't need a car in Berlin](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car). If you want a car, check if there is enough street parking. In central neighbourhoods, you might need a [parking permit](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany#parking). Your building might have basement parking. It usually costs around 120€ per month. You can [park motorcycles on the sidewalk](/guides/motorcycle-parking).
- [ ] **Nearby services**  
    Check if there are supermarkets, [Spätis](/glossary/Späti), cafés and other businesses nearby.
- [ ] **Noise**  
    Main roads are noisy because of trams, cars and ambulances.[^15] Ambulances, trams and trains are *very* loud, even when you close your windows.[^16] Nearby restaurants, bars and [Spätis](/glossary/Späti) can be loud, even at night. - [Noise map of Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/umweltatlas/verkehr-laerm/laermbelastung/2022/karten/artikel.1305256.php)

[![Berlin busy areas](/images/berlin-busy-areas.png "In Google Maps, orange areas are interesting areas. They have good bars and restaurants, but they are busy and loud.")](/images/berlin-busy-areas.png)

[![Berlin tram lines](/images/berlin-tram-lines.png "If you live next to a tram line, you hear trams all day. They are very loud.")](/images/berlin-tram-lines.png)

## 3. Contact the landlord

When you find an apartment you like, contact the landlord and ask to visit the apartment. Do not wait.

In your message, include...[^30]

- [ ] Your occupation ⭐️
- [ ] Your salary ⭐️
- [ ] Your name (and doctor title)
- [ ] Your age
- [ ] Your residence status
- [ ] When you want to move in
- [ ] Who will move in with you
- [ ] A personal introduction
- [ ] A photo of you (optional, but it helps)[^31]
- [ ] Anything that shows that you have [what landlords want](#what-landlords-want)

Write in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to translate your message. Use the [example messages](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/artikel/accommodation-search-example-of-a-successful-flat-application) from WG-Gesucht.

Do not include your documents yet. Only send your documents when you apply for the apartment.

To improve your chances...

- **Be fast**  
    If you like an apartment, do not wait. Landlords get hundreds of messages per hour.[^22] Most apartment listings disappear after a few minutes.[^26] Use [bots, notifications and message templates](#bots-and-automation) to be the fastest to apply . ImmoScout24 Premium lets you message landlords before others.[^33]
- **Send a lot of messages**  
    You might need to send hundreds of messages. Searching for an apartment is a full time job. It can take months.
- **Be prepared**  
    Prepare all the [required documents](#required-documents) in advance. Be ready to send them quickly.
- **Write and call**  
    Most landlords prefer emails, but some prefer calls.[^35] Try both.
- **Have a detailed profile**  
    Create a detailed profile on ImmoScout24 and other websites. When you message a landlord, include all the important information. The first impression is important.
- **Don't be picky**  
    You probably won't get a cheap apartment in a good neighbourhood. Be ready to take what you find. If you are a recent immigrant, you don't have many options.

### What landlords want

Landlords want **stability**. They want quiet tenants who pay rent on time.

In order, they prefer...[^32]

- Couples without children 👍👍👍
- Singles without children 👍👍
- Families with children 👍
- Retirees 👎
- Students 👎👎
- Single parents 👎👎
- [Flatshares](/glossary/WG) 👎👎👎

Landlords prefer...

- **A good income**  
    Your rent should be 20% to 40% of your monthly [net income](/glossary/Netto%20income).[^34] Your income can't be too low or too high.[^48] Two incomes are better than one.
- **A stable job**  
    If you are in your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), it's a little harder to find an apartment.[^36] If you are self-employed, it's much harder.[^17] If you are unemployed, it's impossible.
- **A good first impression**  
    Be nice and pleasant. Your personality matters a lot.[^29]
- **A stable right of residence**  
    You must have a long-term right to live in Germany. If you have a [[National Visa]], it's harder to find an apartment. If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa) or no visa, it's *much* harder. If you are a recent immigrant, you can get a [short-term furnished apartment](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) or a room in a [[WG]].
- **German speakers**  
    If you speak German, it's less work for the landlord. Write in German. Use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to translate messages.
- **Titles**  
    Landlords prefer doctors and professors.[^10] Use your title (*Dr* or *Prof*) when you write to the landlord.

Landlords often avoid...

- **Recent immigrants**  
    Recent immigrants often lose their job, lose their residence permit or move away. Landlords prefer stable tenants. Discrimination also happens.[^9] Some landlords *prefer* immigrants because they pay more and don't know their rights.[^25]
- **People who know their rights**  
    Landlords avoid people who know the rules, like lawyers and government employees.[^24]
- Parents[^29]
- Students
- [Dog owners](/guides/dog-ownership#finding-an-apartment-with-a-dog)

## 4. Visit the apartment

If you are lucky, you will get invited to an apartment visit. Arrive early. Bring all the [required documents](#required-documents). You can usually apply for the apartment at the end of the visit.

It can be a private visit (just you), or an open visit (many other people). Do not go to mass viewings with more than 40 people. They are a waste of time.[^20]

### Apartment visit checklist

- [ ] **Appliances**  
    Check what appliances fit in the apartment. Do you need a smaller washing machine? Is there room for a dishwasher? Does your bed fit in the bedroom?
- [ ] **Noise**  
    How is the soundproofing? Can you hear the neighbours? Can you hear the noise outside? Traffic, ambulances, bars and other noise can be a problem.
- [ ] **Neighbours**  
    Check who your neighbours are. If you visit the apartment during the day, it can be quieter than in the evening, when all your neighbours are at home.
- [ ] **Mold**  
    Look for [mold stains](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moldy_livingroom_Panewniki_01.jpg) around windows and in the corners of the rooms. Mold problems can be hard to fix.
- [ ] **Hausordnung**  
    Each building has different house rules (*[[Hausordnung]]*). The *Hausordnung* often has rules about [quiet hours](/guides/quiet-hours), grilling, ventilation, musical instruments, vehicles and pets.[^40]

### Visiting a flat share

*[[WG]]* visits are more like an interview. You meet your future roommates, and they decide if they like you.[^41] Some interviews are very informal: you might meet to have a drink or even play board games together.

The interview for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* is usually shorter. Your roommate wants to save money. They don't care so much about being your friend.

### How to behave during the visit

- **Dress well**  
    Make a good impression. You don't need a suit, just clean clothes, clean shoes, and socks without holes.[^11]
- **Be on time**  
    Arrive a little early. You will have more time to find the place and meet the landlord. If you are late, message the landlord as soon as possible.[^28]
- **Be pleasant**  
    Be polite and friendly. Greet the landlord or the agent. Speak German if you can.
- **Don't complain**  
    If you start finding problems with the apartment, you look like you will be a difficult tenant.
- **Don't negotiate**  
    The rent is not negotiable. There are dozens of other candidates. The price will not go down.

## 5. Apply for the apartment

If you like the apartment, apply for it as soon as you can. Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents) in advance.

![Berlin apartment documents](/illustrations/berlin-apartment-documents.png)

### Required documents

To apply for an apartment, you need these documents:[^19]

- [ ] **[[Schufa]] report**  
    You can [get one for free](/guides/schufa). If you can't get a Schufa, bring a work contract or a [tax return](/glossary/Steuerbescheid) to prove your income. Furnished apartments from [Homelike](/out/homelike), [Spotahome](/out/spotahome), [Wunderflats](/out/wunderflats) don't ask for a Schufa.[^37]
- [ ] **Passport or [[Personalausweis]]**
- [ ] **Proof of income**  
    There are many ways to prove your income:
    - [ ] Work contract
    - [ ] Last 3 payslips
    - [ ] Profit and loss statement (if self-employed)
    - [ ] Last [tax statement](/glossary/Steuerbescheid)
    - [ ] Bank account statement, but landlords trust them less[^38]
- [ ] **[[Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung]]** (optional)  
    This document proves that you don't owe money to your previous landlord. You get it from your previous landlord. It does not have a standard format, but you can use [this template](/documents/Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung-muster.pdf). You can also use bank statements to show that you pay rent every month.[^47]
- [ ] **[[Mietbürgschaft]]** (optional)  
    If you have a low or unstable income, someone can be your guarantor. If you don't pay rent, they must pay it for you. It's useful for students and freelancers. Use [this *Mietbürgschaft* template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyhRVDPmmzkER5ElnPSlAR3J5ohw2j32/view).
- [ ] **Application form** (optional)  
    If an agency listed the apartment, download their application form (*Selbstauskunft*) and fill it in advance.
- [ ] **Copies of everything**  
    Give censored copies to the landlord. Keep the originals.
- [ ] **Pen**

**Combine your documents** into one PDF. Landlords prefer that.[^42] Use a [PDF merging tool](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html).

Identity theft is a big risk. To protect yourself, [censor your documents](/guides/housing-scams#censor-your-documents) before you send them.

## 6. Sign the lease and move in

If the landlord chooses you, they will ask for your documents.

You will sign a lease, pay the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution), get the keys and move in. You must register your address, put your name on the mailbox, and change your address.

**[How to move in ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

## Your housing options

### Regular apartment

Regular apartments are a **long-term solution**. They are hard to get, because everyone wants them. If you are unemployed, if you are a student, or if you are not in Germany yet, regular apartments are almost impossible to get.

With a regular apartment...

- **Nothing is included**  
    They come with no furniture, appliances, light fixtures or curtains. They are completely empty. You must buy everything yourself. You must also get an internet contract and an electricity contract. In Berlin, they must come with a stove and a sink.[^3]
- **You can stay forever**  
    The lease is unlimited (*unbefristet*). Once you move in, it's your home. It's really hard to kick you out.

**[Look for a regular apartment ↑](#look-for-apartments)**

### Short-term, furnished apartment

Furnished apartments are a **temporary solution**. Use them to move to Berlin, then look for something better. If you are not in Germany yet, it might be your only option.

Furnished apartments are...

- **Immigrant-friendly**  
    You can book them months before you come to Germany. You don't need to speak German. You don't need a stable job, a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), a *[[Schufa]]* or a [deposit](/glossary/Kaution).
- **Convenient**  
    They include everything you need: furniture, appliances, cookware, internet and electricity. You can just [move in](/guides/moving-in) and focus on other problems.
- **Temporary**  
    Your lease has an end date. When it ends, you must move out. You can't leave early, and you usually can't stay longer.
- **Overpriced**  
    They are *very* expensive; more than twice the price of a regular apartment. They are a really bad deal.

You can also rent someone's furnished room while they travel. It gives you a place to stay for a few weeks. Usually, you can't do your *[[Anmeldung]]* there, so it's a bad option. The *Anmeldung* is [really important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address).

There are also [hotels and hostels where you can do your *Anmeldung*](https://nomadandinlove.com/anmeldung-apartment-hotels-berlin/).

**[Look for short-term housing ↑](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments)**

### Room in a [[WG]]

Renting a room in a [shared apartment](/glossary/WG) is a **cheaper solution**. Rooms in a WG are really hard to find.[^6]

Short-term rooms are easier to find. You usually rent someone's room they travel. Usually, you can't do your *[[Anmeldung]]* there, so they are a bad option.

Rooms in a WG are...

- **Cheaper**  
    You split the rent, internet, electricity, [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag) and other bills with other people. Since the rent is lower, the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) is also lower.
- **Convenient**  
    Your roommates already have some furniture and cookware that you can use. The internet and utilities are already connected. You might only need furniture for your room. You don't need to furnish a whole apartment.

Usually, you must meet your roommates for an interview. Most WG interviews are like a personality test or a culture fit test. Interviews for a *[[Zweck-WG]]* are more formal.

**[Look for a room in a WG ↑](#wgs-flat-shares-and-roommates)**

### Student housing

Student dorms are the **cheapest option for students**, but they are hard to get. There are long waiting lists.[^43] You can get luxury student housing. It's very expensive, but it comes with everything you need.

**[How to apply for student housing](https://www.stw.berlin/wohnen/faq-wohnen/wie-bewerbe-ich-mich-um-einen-wohnplatz.html)** (in German) - StudierendenWERK Berlin

**[Look for student housing ↑](#dorms-and-student-housing)**

### Buying an apartment

If you just moved to Berlin, **don't buy an apartment**. Buying is harder than renting. If you just started a new job, you won't get a mortgage. If you don't have EU citizenship or [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you won't get a mortgage.

## Important knowledge

### Anmeldung

Always choose a place where you can register your address (the *[[Anmeldung]]*). If you can't register your address, it will make your life much harder. Some short-term apartments don't allow the *Anmeldung*. Don't choose those places.

**[Why the Anmeldung is important ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address)**

### Deposit

Almost all apartments require a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). It's usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You get it back after you [move out](/guides/moving-out). You can [pay it in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You must pay the first instalment before you [move in](/guides/moving-in). If you don't have enough money, there are [other options](/guides/mietkaution#if-you-dont-have-enough-money).

Some short-term apartments on [HousingAnywhere](/out/housinganywhere) and [Spotahome](/out/spotahome) apartments don't ask for a deposit.

**[How the deposit works ➞](/guides/mietkaution)**

### Cold rent and warm rent

The warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*) is what you pay every month. It's the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) plus utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*).

The *Nebenkosten* usually include:

- Heating
- Hot water (most of the time)
- Trash collection
- Cleaning and landscaping

The *Nebenkosten* are not a fixed cost, because you don't know how much water and heating you really use. Your landlord adjusts the *Nebenkosten* every year based on your usage. You pay what your landlord pays. Your landlord can't make a profit on *Nebenkosten*.

### Nothing is included

Apartments usually come without a washing machine, curtains, light fixtures or a furnished kitchen (stove, fridge, sink). You must buy your own, or buy them from the previous tenant. In Berlin, apartments *must* include a stove and a sink,[^3] but not in the rest of Germany.

[Furnished apartments](#short-term-and-furnished-apartments) come with the kitchen, furniture and everything you need, but they are very expensive.

Sometimes, the previous tenants want you to buy their furniture. They usually ask for a really high price, because they know you want the apartment. It's a [common scam](/guides/housing-scams#buy-the-furniture-to-get-the-flat).

### Rent is paid by bank transfer

You usually pay rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). You rarely pay rent with cash, and never with cheques. If the landlord uses another payment method, it's probably a [scam](/guides/housing-scams).

You need a European bank account to make bank transfers. Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from a non-EU country.

### Rooms and floors

Rooms and floors are not counted the same way everywhere.

In Germany, the living room also counts as a room. A studio is a *1 Zimmer Wohnung*. A 2-bedroom apartment with a living room is a *3 Zimmer Wohnung*. The kitchen, the bathroom and the hallway do not count as rooms.

[![Apartment floor plan berlin](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)](/illustrations/apartment-floor-plan-berlin.png)

In many countries, the first floor is the ground floor. In Germany, the first floor is above the ground floor.
