They will give you a plastic payment card. Bring it to the payment machine in the building, and pay the fee. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt. After you paid, you can go home.

## Going in person

You can't go in person without an appointment. They will tell you to go home.

## Need help?

The immigration office does not give immigration advice. An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions. Some organisations can also help you for free.
