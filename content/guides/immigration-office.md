## How to contact the Ausländerbehörde

The *Ausländerbehörde* is hard to contact.

1. **[Find your department](#departments)**
2. **[Use the contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**  
    Find your department's contact form. If it's urgent, use the [emergency form](#emergencies). Write in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator). Use PDF files or photos. Don't use word documents or other formats. If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). If you apply for a residence permit, send a complete application; don't wait for them to ask for your documents.
4. **Wait for a response**  
    They [take a long time to reply](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times).
5. **Reply to their messages**  
    They will reply by email. Sometimes, you can't reply to their email, so you must use the contact form again.

### Emergencies

If it's urgent, choose the *Eiliger Termin/Notfall* category in the contact form.[^1]

## How to get an appointment

You need an appointment to visit the *Ausländerbehörde*. If you go without an appointment, they will tell you to go home.[^3]

Since August 2024, **there is no appointment booking system**.[^2] To get an appointment, you must apply for a residence permit or use their contact form, and wait for a response.

## Wait times

It usually takes a few months to get a residence permit in Berlin. The wait times vary by department and residence permit type.

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

It might be cheaper and safer to apply for a [[National Visa]] in your home country, and move to Berlin once you have permission to work or study. Then you don't need to wait in Berlin without an income.

## Payment methods

At the *Ausländerbehörde*, you can pay with Visa, Mastercard, cash and [[Girocard]].[^4]

When you apply for a residence permit online, you sometimes need to pay in advance. You can pay with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. You can't pay with cash or [[Girocard]].[^5]

### How to pay

They will give you a plastic payment card. Bring it to the payment machine in the building, and pay the fee. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt. After you paid, you can go home. You don't need to bring the proof of payment to your case worker.

## Suing the Ausländerbehörde

## Need help?

The immigration office does not give immigration advice. An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions. Some organisations can also help you for free.
