## How to contact the Ausländerbehörde

**[See the full list ➞](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/en/services/our-services/artikel.878424.en.php)**

If your residence permit is not in this list, send your application through the [contact form](#use-the-contact-form).

### Use the contact form

To contact the *Ausländerbehörde*, or to apply for a residence permit that is not in [this list](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/en/services/our-services/artikel.878424.en.php), you must...

1. **[Find your department](#departments)**
2. **[Use the contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**  
    Find your department's contact form. Write in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator). If it's urgent, use the [emergency form](#emergencies). Your message must include...
    - [ ] Your name and date of birth
    - [ ] What you need
    - [ ] The expiration date of your visa or residence permit
    - [ ] [If your visa or residence permit expires soon](/guides/residence-permit#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires), ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*[^7]
3. **Attach your documents**  
    Add your application documents to your message. Complete applications are processed faster.[^9] You can only upload 5 small files. Use PDF files or photos, nothing else. If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) and [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). If you still have too many documents, mail them.
4. **Send your message**  
    If you get an error (*Anti-Spam-Schutz*), it's because you took too long to send your message. Click the back button, and send it again. After you send the message, click *Zusammenfassung ausdrucken* to print the confirmation message. This is a proof of your residence permit application. You might not get a confirmation email.[^8]
5. **Wait for a response**  
    They reply [very slowly](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#sue-the-auslanderbehorde). [If your visa or resident permit expires](/guides/residence-permit#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires), it's usually extended until the *Ausländerbehörde* processes your application. Sometimes, you can't reply to their emails directly, so you must use the contact form again.

**[What happens next? ➞](/guides/residence-permit#wait)

### Other contact options

You can contact the *Ausländerbehörde* by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief), but it's not better or faster.[^6] You can't call or fax them.[^10]

Address your letter to the correct [department](#departments), at the correct address: [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://service.berlin.de/standort/121885/) or [Keplerstraße](https://service.berlin.de/standort/327437/).

**[How to mail a letter ➞](/guides/mail-a-letter)**

### Emergencies

If it's urgent, choose the *Eiliger Termin/Notfall* category in the contact form.[^1]

![How to choose the emergency appointment option on the LEA contact form](/images/lea-emergency-form.png)

### Locations

In Berlin, there are 3 immigration office locations. Choose the correct one.

    For everyone else. They handle permanent residence, freelance visas, and everything else. Choose the department that is responsible for your country.

## How to get an appointment

To visit the *Ausländerbehörde*, you need an appointment. If you go without an appointment, they will not help you.[^3]

Since August 2024, **you can't book an appointment**.[^2] You must [apply for a residence permit](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-apply-in-berlin) or [use their contact form](#how-to-contact-the-auslanderbehorde). They decide when they give you an appointment. They can take weeks or months to reply.

## Wait times

It usually takes a few months to get a residence permit in Berlin. The wait times vary by department and residence permit type.

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

Usually, you can't work or study before you get your residence permit. It might be cheaper to apply in your home country. You can move to Berlin after you get permission to work or study. You don't need to wait in Berlin without an income.

**[How to apply in your country ➞](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-apply-in-your-country)**

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/allTypes.html" %}

## Payment methods

At the *Ausländerbehörde*, you can pay with Visa, Mastercard, cash or [[Girocard]].[^4]

When you apply for a residence permit online, you sometimes need to pay in advance, during your application. You can pay with Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. You can't pay with cash or [[Girocard]].[^5]

### How to pay

At the end of your appointment, you get a plastic [payment card](/images/auslanderbehoerde-kassenkarte.jpg) (*Kassenkarte*). Bring it to a [payment machine](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg) (*Kassenautomat*). Follow [the signs](/images/auslanderbehoerde-signs.jpg) to find it. These machines accept cash, EC cards, Visa and Mastercard.[^4] If your card is not accepted, get cash from an ATM.

![Ausländerbehörde Kassenautomat](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg)

![Ausländerbehörde Kassenautomat](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat-2.jpg "Payment machines at the Ausländerbehörde")

After you paid, you can go home. You don't need to go back to your case worker. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt. 

## Sue the Ausländerbehörde

After you submit your residence permit application, the *Ausländerbehörde* has 3 months to make a decision. If they don't answer after 3 months, you can sue them for inaction.[^11] This is called an *Untätigkeitsklage nach [§ 75 VwGO](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwgo/__75.html)*. Usually, it makes them move faster.[^12]

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

If your case goes to court, the state usually pays for your legal expenses. In most cases, the *Ausländerbehörde* reacts before the court, so you must pay your own legal fees.

In other words, you pay a lawyer around 400€, and things maybe go a little faster.[^13]

## Need help?

The immigration office does not give immigration advice. An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions. Some organisations can also help you for free.
