## How to contact the Ausländerbehörde

The *Ausländerbehörde* is hard to contact.
### Contact form

1. **[Find your department](#departments)**
2. **[Use the contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**  
    Find your department's contact form. If it's urgent, use the [emergency form](#emergencies). Write in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator). Your message must include...
    - [ ] What you need
    - [ ] Your name and date of birth
    - [ ] The expiration date of your visa or residence permit
    - [ ] If your residence permit expires soon, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*[^7] - [More information](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)
3. **Attach your documents**  
    Add your application documents to your message. Complete applications are processed faster.[^9] You can only upload 5 small files. Use PDF files or photos, nothing else. If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) and [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). If you still have too many documents, mail them.
4. **Send your message**  
    If you get an error (*Anti-Spam-Schutz*), it's because you took too long to send your message. Click the back button, and send it again. After you send the message, click *Zusammenfassung ausdrucken* to print the confirmation message. This is a proof of your residence permit application. You might not get a confirmation email.[^8]
5. **Wait for a response**  
    They reply by email. They [take a long time to reply](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#sue-the-auslanderbehorde). If you sent a complete application, your visa or residence permit stays valid until the *Ausländerbehörde* processes it.

### Other contact options

You can contact the *Ausländerbehörde* by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief), but it's not better or faster.[^6] You can't call or fax them.[^10]

### Emergencies

If it's urgent, choose the *Eiliger Termin/Notfall* category in the contact form.[^1]

## How to get an appointment

You need an appointment to visit the *Ausländerbehörde*. If you go without an appointment, they will tell you to go home.[^3]

Since August 2024, **there is no appointment booking system**.[^2] To get an appointment, you must [apply for a residence permit](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-apply-in-berlin) or [use their contact form](#how-to-contact-the-auslanderbehorde). They can take months to reply.

## Wait times

It usually takes a few months to get a residence permit in Berlin. The wait times vary by department and residence permit type.

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

It's often cheaper and safer to apply for a [[National Visa]] in your home country, and move to Berlin once you have permission to work or study. Then you don't need to wait in Berlin without an income.???Rephrase???

## Payment methods

At the *Ausländerbehörde*, you can pay with Visa, Mastercard, cash and [[Girocard]].[^4]

When you apply for a residence permit online, you sometimes need to pay in advance. You can pay with Visa, Mastercard and PayPal. You can't pay with cash or [[Girocard]].[^5]

### How to pay

They will give you a plastic payment card. Bring it to the payment machine in the building, and pay the fee. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt. After you paid, you can go home. You don't need to bring the proof of payment to your case worker.

## Sue the Ausländerbehörde

## Need help?

The immigration office does not give immigration advice. An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions. Some organisations can also help you for free.
