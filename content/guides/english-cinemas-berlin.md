## OmU? OV? OmeU?

- **OmU** means original version with subtitles (*Original mit Untertiteln*). The subtitles are usually in German.
- **OmeU** means original version with English subtitles (*Originalversion mit englischen Untertiteln*).
- **OmU+** means original version with English *and* German subtitles.
- **OV** means original version. The movie is in its original language, and there are no subtitles.

## English movie playtimes

Berlin.de has a [list of movies in their original language](https://www.berlin.de/kino/_bin/azfilm.php/ov), but it's hard to use. I prefer [OV-Berlin](https://ov-berlin.info/movies/) and [englishcinemaberlin.com].

## List of cinemas

These cinemas usually screen movies in English, with or without subtitles. [Yorck Kinos](https://www.yorck.de/en) usually have movies in English.

In the summer, some of these cinemas also screen open air movies. You can watch movies outdoors.
