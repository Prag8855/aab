## Before you move

### Save money

Moving to Germany is expensive. You need enough money to cover relocation expenses, and to survive until your first paycheck.

You need enough money for...

- **The apartment deposit** (*[[Kaution]]*)  
    It's 3 times your [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You must pay 1/3 of the deposit before you move in, 1/3 after one month, and 1/3 after two months. - [How apartment deposits work](/guides/mietkaution)
- **The first month of rent**  
    You must pay it by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung) before you [move in](/guides/moving-in).
- **Your [living expenses](/guides/cost-of-living)**  
    You must buy food and things for your apartment. You might also need to buy furniture and appliances. If you find a furnished apartment or a [[WG]]; it comes with everything you need.
- **Your relocation expenses**  
    If you come from another country, you might need to buy plane tickets, or stay in a hotel for a few days. Relocation and moving expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^4] Save the receipts for your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung).
- **Winter clothes**  
    German winters are cold and humid. It's 0ºC on average, and as low as -10ºC.[^5] You need winter clothes: a warm jacket, boots, gloves, and a hat.

Your employer might offer a relocation bonus to cover your relocation expenses. You usually get it *after* you start working, so you still need savings.

**[Cost of living in Berlin ➞](/guides/cost-of-living)**

### Find a job

There are [English-speaking jobs in Berlin](/guides/english-speaking-jobs-berlin), but most jobs require German.

**[How to find a job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

You might need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live and work in Germany. Some residence permits require a job offer. You might need to wait for your residence permit before you start working. It can take [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to get.

**[Residence permits for work ➞](/guides/residence-permit#for-work)**

### Find a place to live

It's *really* hard to find an apartment in Berlin. It can take months. Rent a temporary furnished apartment, then move to Berlin, then find something better. Temporary housing is expensive, but it might be your only option.

**[How to find an apartment ➞](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**

Before you [move in](/guides/moving-in), you must pay the first month's rent, and 1/3 of the deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). You pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). [Open a bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany) or use [Wise](/out/wise) to send money from another country.

Be careful while looking for apartments. There are a lot of [housing scams](/guides/housing-scams). If you are not in Germany, use a platform with verified landlords like [Homelike](/out/homelike), [HousingAnywhere](/out/housinganywhere) or [Spotahome](/out/spotahome). They only pay the landlord after you [move in](/guides/moving-in). If the apartment is not as described, you get your money back.

### Get health insurance

If you live in Germany, you need [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). It's required when you apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).

Use my [health insurance calculator](/guides/german-health-insurance) to see your options, then [talk to an insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). It's the best way to get health insurance.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

**[How to choose health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

If you are an EU citizen, your [EHIC card](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries) covers you until you start working. If you are a student, your EHIC card covers you until you graduate.

### Apply for a residence permit

If you are not a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) or [[EEA]] citizen, you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live, work or study in Germany. It can take [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to get a residence permit. You might need it before you start working or studying. Apply for it as soon as you can.

**[How to get a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-get-a-residence-permit)**

## Your first month in Berlin

### Open a bank account

Open a bank account as soon as you can. You need it to pay rent and receive paychecks. You can use a bank from any European country.

Some banks don't let immigrants open an account. They might refuse your passport, or ask for documents that you don't have. Choose an expat-friendly bank.

**[Best German banks for expats ➞](/guides/best-bank-germany)**

To send money from another country, use [Wise](/out/wise).

### Get a mobile phone contract

**Before you arrive**, [buy a temporary eSIM card](/out/airalo). Buy it online, and activate it when you arrive. You will have mobile data as soon as you arrive in Germany. You can buy a temporary SIM card at the airport, but they are more expensive.

You can also use a SIM card from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country. It will work for a few months at no extra cost. When it stops working, you need a German SIM card.[^0]

**After you arrive**, get a cheaper phone plan from...

- Vodafone, Telekom and O2 stores
- Saturn, MediaMarkt and [other electronics stores](/guides/where-to-buy-what#electronics)
- Aldi and Lidl supermarkets, at the counter

Use [Verivox](/out/verivox-cellphone) to compare cellphone plans. Prepaid plans are often much cheaper. I use [Vodafone CallYa](/out/vodafone-callya) since 2015. [Aldi Talk](/out/aldi-talk) is another good, cheap option.

To activate your SIM card, you might need your passport and your [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung).[^1] If you don't have a registration certificate, they might just use your temporary address.[^2]

### Move into your apartment

After you [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), you must move in. You must [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), learn to [sort your trash](/guides/sorting-trash-in-germany), put your name on your mailbox and a lot more.

**[How to move into an apartment ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

### Register your address

You must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) after you move in. It's mandatory. This is how you get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) and a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer). You need the registration certificate to use government services. Your employer needs your tax ID to pay you correctly.

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

### Get liability insurance

After you move in, get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung). It's the most important insurance after health insurance. Most people have it.

**[What is liability insurance? ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

### Start working

You might need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to start working. During your first month, your employer will need a few things like your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer), health insurance number and [pension insurance number](/glossary/Sozialversicherungsnummer).

You should also learn about your rights. Understand how the [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), vacation days and sick days work. Know what happens if you lose your job.

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working)**

### Bring your family

Your family can move to Germany with you. They might need a residence permit like the [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa).

If you have children, you might need to send them to a daycare (*[[Kita]]*). It's really hard to find a Kita. There are long waiting lists.

**[How to find a Kita ➞](/guides/how-to-find-a-kita-in-berlin)**

You can also bring your pets to Germany. If you bring your dog to Berlin, you must [microchip](/guides/dog-ownership#identification-chip), [insure](/guides/dog-ownership#dog-liability-insurance) and [register](/guides/dog-ownership#dog-register) it. You must also adjust to German dog culture.

**[Having a dog in Berlin ➞](/guides/dog-ownership)**

### Get around in Berlin

Berlin has excellent public transit. You should also get a bike; it's a good way to explore Berlin in the summer.

**[How to use public transit ➞](/guides/public-transit)**

**[How to buy a bicycle ➞](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin)**

You don't need to [buy a car](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany) in Berlin. They are [expensive](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany), and [not so useful](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car).

Your foreign driving licence [might be valid in Germany](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence#can-you-already-drive-in-germany). You can sometimes convert it to a German driving licence. You can also take driving lessons in Berlin.

### Make friends

It takes time to make friends in Berlin. It's normal to feel lonely in your first year. Berlin has a big expat community, so you will find people to meet, even if you don't speak German.

**[How to make friends ➞](/guides/making-friends)**

### Learn German

You don't need to speak German to move to Berlin, but [it's *very* useful](/guides/learn-german#do-i-need-to-speak-german-in-berlin). You always need to write emails, read letters and make phone calls in German. If you don't speak German, you always depend on someone else to help you. If you speak German, it's easier to [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) and [make friends](/guides/making-friends).

**[How to learn German in Berlin ➞](/guides/learn-german)**

### Adjust to life in Germany

After you settle in Berlin, get familiar with German culture:

- learn [how to sort your trash](/guides/sorting-trash-in-germany) and [return empty bottles](/guides/pfand-bottles)
- learn [how to safely stream movies and shows](/guides/pirating-streaming-movies-in-germany)
- respect the [quiet hours](/guides/quiet-hours)
- remember that [most businesses close on Sundays](/guides/open-on-sundays-in-berlin)
- [make a budget](/guides/cost-of-living) and find ways to [save money](/guides/saving-money-germany)
- understand [how German phone numbers work](/guides/dial-phone-numbers-germany)

- [English-speaking **barbers** and hair salons in Berlin](/guides/hairdressers-hairstylists-barbers-berlin)
- [English-speaking **gynaecologists** in Berlin](/guides/english-speaking-gynecologists-berlin)

### Find a doctor

In Germany, when you have a health problem, you go to your *[[Hausarzt]]*. Find your *Hausarzt* before you need one. It will be easier to see a doctor when you are sick. This is useful when you need a [sick note](/glossary/Krankschreibung) for your employer.

**[Find an English-speaking doctor ➞](/guides/english-speaking-doctors-berlin)**

### Make a tax declaration

Your relocation expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). If you move in the middle of the year, you probably paid too much [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer). Make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung) to get some money back. A [tax advisor](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin) can help you.

## After you settle

### Permanent residence and citizenship

After a few years in Germany, you can apply for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or German citizenship.

Permanent residence gives you more freedom and more security. You don't need to renew it like a residence permit. You can stay in Germany even if you lose your job.

Depending on your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), you can become a permanent resident after 21 to 60 months in Germany.

**[How to apply for permanent residence ➞](/guides/permanent-residence)**

Citizenship is better than permanent residence. You get a German passport, and you can vote in elections.
