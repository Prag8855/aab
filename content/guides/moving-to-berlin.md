## Summary

Before you move to Germany, you might need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). A residence permit gives you the right to live in Germany.

To get a residence permit, you usually need a job offer, [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung), and a place to live. The first step is to [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), then [an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) and [health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance).

Finding an apartment is usually the hardest step. If you are not yet in Berlin, you don't have many options. You might need expensive short-term housing.

Moving to Germany costs a lot of money. You need savings. Your employer might offer a relocation bonus, or pay some of your relocation costs.

After you arrive in Germany, you need a [bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany) and a SIM card for your phone. When you move into your apartment, you must [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin).

## Before you move

### Save money

You need enough money to survive until you get paid. You need money for...

- **The apartment deposit** (*[[Kaution]]*)  
    It's 3 times your [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You must pay 1/3 of the deposit before you move in, 1/3 after one month, and 1/3 after two months. - [How apartment deposits work](/guides/mietkaution)
- **The first month of rent**  
    You must pay it by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung) before you [move in](/guides/moving-in).
- **Your [living expenses](/guides/cost-of-living)**  
    You must buy food and things for your apartment. You might also need to buy furniture and appliances. It's easier if you find a furnished apartment or a [[WG]]; it comes with everything you need.
- **Your relocation expenses**  
    If you come from another country, you might need to buy plane tickets, or stay in a hotel for a few days. Relocation and moving expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^4] Save the receipts for your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung).
- **Winter clothes**  
    German winters are cold and wet. It's 0ºC on average, and as low as -10ºC.[^5] You need winter clothes: a jacket, boots, gloves, and a hat.

Some employers offer a relocation bonus. It covers your relocation expenses. Relocation expenses are usually reimbursed after you start working, so you still need to have savings.

### Find a job

**[How to find a job in Berlin ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

If you are not a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) or [[EEA]] citizen, you usually need a job offer to apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). If you are unemployed, it's harder to find an apartment.

You don't need to speak German to work in Berlin, but it really helps. There are [English-speaking jobs](/guides/english-speaking-jobs-berlin), but most jobs require German.

### Find a place to live

It's *really* hard to find an apartment in Berlin. It's harder if you are not in Berlin, you don't have a stable job, and you don't speak German. Start looking as soon as you can.

**[How to find an apartment in Berlin ➞](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**

The best option is to get a temporary furnished apartment, come to Berlin, then look for something better. It's almost impossible to find a good apartment if you are not in Berlin.

Before you [move in](/guides/moving-in), you must pay the first month's rent, and the deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). In Germany, you pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). [Open a bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany), or use [Wise](/out/wise) to send money from another country.

### Get health insurance

If you live in Germany, you must have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung).

**[How to choose health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

Use my [health insurance calculator](/guides/german-health-insurance) to see your options. The best way to choose health insurance is to [talk to an insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). Their help is free.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

**If you are an EU citizen**, you are covered by your [EHIC card](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries) until you start working. When you start working, you must have German health insurance. If you are a student, you can use your EHIC card while you study. If health insurance is free in your home country, you can save a lot of money with a EHIC card.

### Apply for a residence permit

If you are not a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) or [[EEA]] citizen, you probably need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live in Germany. If you don't qualify for any residence permit, you can't move to Germany.

You can apply for a residence permit at a German embassy or consulate. If you are from {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you can come to Germany, then apply for a residence permit.

**[How to apply for a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit)**

### Check if your devices work in Germany

Germany has 220 volt type F power sockets. Check if your devices work in Germany. You might need a power adapter or a power converter.

**[Power sockets in Germany ➞](/guides/power-sockets)**

### Get a temporary SIM card

[Buy a temporary SIM card](/out/airalo), and activate it when you arrive. This gives you mobile data as soon as you are in Germany. It's very convenient. Later, you can [get a mobile phone contract](#get-a-mobile-phone-contract).

## Your first month in Berlin

### Open a bank account

You need a bank account in the [[European Union]] to make [bank transfers](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung). This is how you pay your rent and receive your paychecks.

If you are not a EU citizen, it can be hard to open a bank account. Banks often require a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung). They don't accept all passports.

**[Best German banks for expats ➞](/guides/best-bank-germany)**

Use [Wise](/out/wise) to send money from another country. You can use it to pay rent without a EU bank account, or to add money to your new bank account.

### Get a mobile phone contract

**Before you arrive**, [buy a temporary SIM card](/out/airalo). You can buy it online, and activate it when you arrive. This gives you mobile data as soon as you are in Germany. You can get a temporary SIM at a kiosk at the airport, but it's more expensive.

**After you arrive**, get a SIM card from...

- Vodafone, Telekom and O2 stores
- Saturn, MediaMarkt and [other electronics stores](/guides/where-to-buy-what#electronics)
- Aldi and Lidl supermarkets

To activate your SIM card, you usually need your passport and your [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung).[^1] If you don't have a registration certificate, they might just use your temporary address.[^2]

You can use a SIM card from any other [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country. It will work for a few months at no extra cost. After some time, your foreign SIM card might stop working, and you will need a German SIM card.[^0]

Use [Verivox](/out/verivox-cellphone) to compare cellphone plans. I use [Vodafone CallYa](/out/vodafone-callya) since 2015. [Aldi Talk](/out/aldi-talk) is another good, cheap option.

### Move in

After you [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), sign the lease and move in. There are a few things to do after that.

**[How to move into an apartment ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

After you move in, get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung). It's cheap, but important. Most people have it.

**[What is liability insurance? ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

### Register your address

You must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) after you move in. You will get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) and a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer). You need them for many other things.

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

### Start working

After you get your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) (if you need one), you can start working. During your first month, your employer will ask for a few things like your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer), health insurance number and [pension insurance number](/glossary/Sozialversicherungsnummer).

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working)**

Know your rights as an employee. Understand how [vacation days](/guides/vacation-days) and [sick days](/guides/sick-leave) work. Know [what happens if you lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job).

Your first 6 months are a [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit). During that time, it's easier to lose your job.

**[How the probation period works ➞](/guides/probezeit)**

### Bring your family

Your family can move to Germany with you. They might need a residence permit like the [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa).

If you have children, you might need to send them to a daycare (*[[Kita]]*). It's really hard to find a Kita. They have long waiting lists.

**[How to find a Kita ➞](/guides/how-to-find-a-kita-in-berlin)**

You can also bring your pets to Germany. If you bring your dog to Berlin, you must [microchip](/guides/dog-ownership#identification-chip), [insure](/guides/dog-ownership#dog-liability-insurance) and [register](/guides/dog-ownership#dog-register) it. You must also adjust to German dog culture.

**[Guide for Berlin dog owners ➞](/guides/dog-ownership)**

### Get around in Berlin

Berlin has excellent public transit. You should also get a bike; it's a good way to explore Berlin in the summer.

**[How to use public transit ➞](/guides/public-transit)**

**[How to buy a bicycle ➞](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin)**

You don't need to [buy a car](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany) in Berlin. They are [expensive](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany), and [not so useful](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car).

Your foreign driving licence [might be valid in Germany](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence#can-you-already-drive-in-germany). You can sometimes convert it to a German driving licence. You can also take driving lessons in Berlin.

**[Find an English-speaking doctor ➞](/guides/english-speaking-doctors-berlin)**

### Make a tax declaration

Your relocation expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). If you move in the middle of the year, you probably paid too much [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer). Make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung) to get some money back. A [tax advisor](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin) can help you.

## A new life in Germany
