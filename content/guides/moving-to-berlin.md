## Before you move

### Save money

You need enough money to live until you get paid. You must pay for these things:

- **The apartment deposit** (*[[Kaution]]*)  
    It's usually 3 times your [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete). You must pay 1/3 of the deposit before your lease begins, 1/3 after the first month, and 1/3 after second month. - [How apartment deposits work](/guides/mietkaution)
- **The first month of rent**  
    You must pay it by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung) before you [move in](/guides/moving-in).
- **Your [living expenses](/guides/cost-of-living)**  
    You must buy food and things for your apartment. You might also need to buy furniture and appliances. If you live in a [[WG]] or a furnished apartment, you don't need to buy as many things.
- **Your relocation expenses**  
    If you come from another country, you might need to buy plane tickets, or stay in a hotel for a few days. Relocation expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^4] Save the receipts for your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung).
- **Winter clothes**  
    German winters are cold and wet. It's 0ºC on average, and as low as -10ºC.[^5] You need winter clothes: a jacket, boots, gloves, and a hat.

### Find a job

**[How to find a job in Berlin ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

If you are not a EU or [[EEA]] citizen, you need a job offer to apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). If you are unemployed, it's harder to find an apartment.

You don't need to speak German to work in Berlin, but it helps a lot. There are many [English-speaking jobs](/guides/english-speaking-jobs-berlin), but most jobs require German.

### Find a place to live

It's *really* hard to find an apartment in Berlin. It's harder if you are not in Berlin, you don't have a stable job, and you don't speak German. Start looking as soon as you can.

**[How to find an apartment in Berlin ➞](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**

Before you [move in](/guides/moving-in), you must pay the first month's rent, and the deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). In Germany, you pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). [Open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), or use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to send money from another country.

### Get health insurance

If you live in Germany, you must have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung).

**[How to choose health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

Use my [health insurance calculator](/guides/german-health-insurance) to see your options. The best way to choose health insurance is to [talk to an insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). Their help is free.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

**If you are an EU citizen**, you are covered by your [EHIC card](/guide/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries) until you start working. When you start working, you must have German health insurance. If you are a student, you can use your EHIC card while you study. If health insurance is free in your home country, you can save a lot of money with a EHIC card.

### Get a residence permit

If you are not a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) or [[EEA]] citizen, you probably need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live in Germany. If you don't qualify for any residence permit, you can't move to Germany.

**[How to apply for a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit)**

### Check if your devices work in Germany

Check if your devices work with German power sockets. Sometimes you just need a cheap power adapter. Sometimes you need an expensive power converter.

**[Power sockets in Germany ➞](/guides/power-sockets)**

## Your first month in Berlin

### Open a bank account

You need a bank account to get paid, and to pay your rent. You can have a bank account in Germany, or anywhere in the European Union.

Some banks require a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung) to open an account. Some banks might refuse your foreign passport. Use my [list of expat-friendly banks](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany#german-banks-for-expats) to find a good bank.

**[How to choose a bank ➞](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**

Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from another country. You can use it to pay your rent for the first time, or to add money to your German bank account.

### Get a mobile phone contract

You can buy get a SIM card from...

- Vodafone, Telekom and O2 stores
- Saturn and MediaMarkt

To activate a SIM card, you need your passport and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung).[^1] If you did not [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) yet, the employee might use your temporary address.[^2]

You can use a SIM card from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country. There is no extra fee. After some time, you must switch to a German mobile plan. Your foreign plan will stop working, unless you return to that country.[^0]

Use [Verivox](/out/verivox-cellphone) to compare cellphone plans. I use [Vodafone CallYa](/out/vodafone-callya) since 2015. [Aldi Talk](/out/aldi-talk) is another good, cheap option. 

### Move in

After you [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), sign the lease and move in. There are a few things to do after that.

**[How to move into an apartment ➞](/guides/moving-in)**

After you move in, get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung). It's cheap, but important.

**[What is liability insurance? ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

### Register your address

After you [move in](/guides/moving-in), you must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). This is how you get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) and a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer). You need them for many other things.

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

### Start working

After you get your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), you can start working. During your first month, your employer will ask for a few things like your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer), health insurance number and [pension insurance number](/glossary/Sozialversicherungsnummer).

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working)**

Your first 6 months are a [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit). During that time, it's easier to [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job).

**[How the probation period works ➞](/guides/probezeit)**

### Bring your family

Your family can move to Germany with you. They might need a residence permit like the [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa).

If you have children, you might need to send them to a daycare (*[[Kita]]*). It's really hard to find a Kita. They have long waiting lists.

**[How to find a Kita ➞](/guides/how-to-find-a-kita-in-berlin)**

You can also bring your pets to Germany. If you bring your dog to Berlin, you must [microchip](/guides/pet-ownership#identification-badge-and-chip), [insure](/guides/pet-ownership#dog-liability-insurance) and [register](/guides/hundesteuer) it. You must also adjust to German dog culture.

**[Dog ownership in Germany ➞](/guides/pet-ownership)**

### Get around in Berlin

Berlin has excellent public transit. You should also get a bike; it's a good way to explore Berlin in the summer.

**[How to use public transit ➞](/guides/public-transit)**

**[How to buy a bicycle ➞](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin)**

You don't need to [buy a car](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany) in Berlin. They are [expensive](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany), and [not so useful](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car).

Your foreign driving licence [might be valid in Germany](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence#can-you-already-drive-in-germany). You can sometimes convert it to a German driving licence. You can also take driving lessons in Berlin.

## Your first year in Berlin

### Discover Berlin

Explore your new city! [Get a bicycle](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin) and explore everything inside and outside the *[Ring](/glossary/Ringbahn)*.

If you move in the winter, Berlin will seem a little grey, but don't panic. It will be much nicer in the summer.

### Make friends

It takes time to make friends in Berlin. It's normal to feel lonely in your first year. Berlin has a big expat community, so you will always find people to meet, even if you don't speak German.

**[How to make friends ➞](/guides/making-friends)**

### Learn German

You don't need to speak German to move to Berlin, but [it's *very* useful](/guides/learn-german#do-i-need-to-speak-german-in-berlin). You always need to write emails, read letters and make phone calls in German. If you don't speak German, you always depend on someone else to help you. If you speak German, it's easier to [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) and [make friends](/guides/making-friends).
