## How to travel to Berlin

### By plane

Use [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com/), [Omio](/out/omio), [Rome2Rio](https://rome2rio.com) or [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) to find a flight to Berlin. You will arrive at the **[Berlin Brandenburg](https://goo.gl/maps/iERwxpTUr7EnYFnKA) airport (BER)**. It's 30-60 minutes from Berlin by train.

There are 3 ways to get from the BER airport to the city:

- **Use [public transport](/guides/public-transit)**  
    You can take a train from BER airport to Berlin, even at night. There are trains every few minutes. Use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/BER+Airport+-+Terminal+1-2/@52.3647378,13.5089418,16.66z) to find directions. The train ride takes 30 to 45 minutes. Buy an [ABC ticket](/guides/public-transit#tariff-zones) at the ticket machines on the train platform. It costs {{BVG_ABC_TICKET|cur}}€.[^2] [Validate](/guides/public-transit#step-2-validate-your-ticket) your ticket before you get on the train. For more information, read the [Berlin public transit guide](/guides/public-transit).
- **Take a taxi**  
    There are taxis waiting outside the BER airport. A taxi from the airport to the city centre costs around 50€.[^3] It's a bit faster than public transport, but it's very expensive. [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/airports/ber/) and [FreeNow](https://free-now.com/de/flughafen) also give rides from the airport to the city. German taxis must accept cash and credit cards.[^4]
- **Rent a car**  
    You can rent a car at the airport. There are kiosks for different car rental companies. You can also use car sharing services like [Miles](https://support.miles-mobility.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021219459-Airport-rate-Berlin-Potsdam), and drive to Berlin for only 25€.

### By bus

Intercity buses are usually cheaper than planes and trains. They are not very comfortable, but they are cheap. Most buses have free Wi-Fi and power outlets under the seats. The Wi-Fi is not very reliable.

Most buses arrive at [BER airport](https://goo.gl/maps/xwWrEedtNxMBxeX96), [Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof](https://goo.gl/maps/m5e93UyQamw4YvDY6) (ZOB) or [Alexanderplatz](https://goo.gl/maps/Mg5nKPhJzAS7fLNdA). BER airport is around 45 minutes from the centre. ZOB is 25 minutes from the centre. Alexanderplatz is in the city centre. If you arrive at BER airport, you need an [ABC train ticket](/guides/public-transit#tariff-zones) to get to Berlin.

Use [Rome2Rio](https://rome2rio.com) or [Omio](/out/omio) to find a bus to Berlin. If you buy your ticket in advance, it's cheaper.

### By train

Intercity trains are a little more expensive than buses, but they are faster and more comfortable. They often have free Wi-Fi and power outlets under the seats. The Wi-Fi is not very reliable.

Most trains stop at the central train station, [Berlin Hauptbahnhof](https://goo.gl/maps/yXUBcBH9cGnx1dP46). This is in the middle of Berlin.

Use [Rome2Rio](https://rome2rio.com), [Omio](/out/omio), [Bahn.de](/out/bahn) or [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) to find a train to Berlin. If you buy your tickets in advance, they will be cheaper.

### By car or motorcycle

Driving in Berlin is easy, but free parking is hard to find.

Most parking spaces in the centre cost money.[^5] They cost 1€ to 4€ per hour.[^6] Use [Parkopedia](https://www.parkopedia.com) to find a free or paid parking space. Most parking spaces outside of the central neighbourhoods are free. [Motorcycles can park on the sidewalk](/guides/motorcycle-parking) for free. It's always easy to park a motorcycle.

You can also park outside the city and take the train to Berlin. There are free [Park and Ride (P+R) car parks](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1lfZOUDUCPL1UgzHwGptdyyfhwEk). You can park your car there for free, and take the train to Berlin. You can find them on [this map](https://www.vbb.de/en/vbb-travel-info/) (in Multi-mobility), or with [this list](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/car-parks).

The area inside the *[[Ringbahn]]* is an [environmental zone](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/luftqualitaet/umweltzone/index_en.shtml). You need a [green environmental sticker](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-environmental-zone) to drive in this area. You can get a green sticker at most gas stations around Berlin. Motorcycles don't need a green sticker to enter this zone.

**[Information about the environmental zone](https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/luftqualitaet/umweltzone/index_en.shtml)** - Berlin.de

### By car sharing

[BlaBlaCar](/out/blablacar) lets you ride with drivers who travel to Berlin. You meet them in one place, and drive together to another city. Car sharing is usually cheaper and faster than intercity buses, but it takes more planning.

## How to get around in Berlin

### How to find your way around Berlin

[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) works really well in Berlin. It also works offline. The [BVG app](http://www.bvg.de/en/Travel-information/Mobile) and the [Jelbi app](https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/) let you see train schedules and buy train tickets, but it does not work offline. [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) and [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) have offline maps and directions.

### How to use public transit in Berlin

Berlin has very good public transit. It's the best way to get around, even when you have a car. Just make sure you [buy the right ticket](/guides/public-transit#tariff-zones) and [validate it](/guides/public-transit#step-2-validate-your-ticket). If you are caught with the wrong ticket, you will get a [{{BVG_FINE|cur}}€ fine](/guides/paying-a-bvg-fine).

You can buy a 24 hour, 7 day or 1 month ticket. It's cheaper than buying a ticket every time. There's also the [WelcomeCard](https://www.berlin-welcomecard.de/en), a ticket that gives you rebates on museums and attractions.

**[How to use public transit ➞](/guides/public-transit)**

### How to rent a bicycle or a scooter

**This is the best way to see Berlin**. Berlin is very flat and has a lot of bike paths, so it's easy to ride a bicycle or a scooter. You can rent them for around 10€ per day.

When I have visitors, this is my favourite way to show Berlin. I take my visitors along the river Spree and the Landwehrkanal.

**[Where to rent a bicycle ➞](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin#renting-a-bicycle)**

**[Where to rent an electric scooter ➞](/guides/public-transit#rent-a-scooter)**

### How to rent a car

You don't need to rent a car in Berlin. It's easier to use public transit. If you have an International Driving Permit or a EU driver's licence, you can drive in Germany.

### Walking tours

Guided tours are a great way to discover Berlin. Use [GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/s/?q=Berlin,%20Germany) to find walking tours, or look at [this list](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/guided-walking-tour-berlin). I highly recommend the [Berliner Unterwelten](https://www.berliner-unterwelten.de/en/index.html) tours.

### Outside of Berlin

If you have a bit more time, [**Potsdam**](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Potsdam) and **[Wannsee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wannsee,+Berlin/@52.4197082,13.1025382,13z/)** are worth a visit. You can get there by train. Potsdam is in [zone C](/guides/public-transit#tariff-zones), so you need an ABC ticket.

### Clubs in Berlin

Berlin is famous for its techno clubs. It can be hard to get into certain clubs. Clubs don't let everyone in. For example, they often reject tourists, big groups, drunk people, and people under 21 years old.[^7] In Berlin, people don't wear fancy clothes to go clubbing. If you dress too nice, you won't get in.[^8] Most clubs have a cover charge. You must pay 5€ to 15€ to get in. Clubs in Berlin stay open until the morning. The party starts late, and the busiest time is around 2AM.

You can buy presale tickets for club events on [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/guide/de/berlin). When you have tickets, it's easier to get in.[^9]

You can find club events on [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/guide/de/berlin), or follow clubs on Facebook. [WikiTravel](http://wikitravel.org/en/Berlin#Clubs) also has a short guide to Berlin clubs.

## What to eat in Berlin

### Typical Berlin street food

- [**Currywurst**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currywurst) - Currywurst is street food. It's a pork sausage with a curry and ketchup sauce. It's usually served with fries (*mit Pommes*) in a cardboard plate. [Curry 36](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Curry+36/@52.540513,13.3772295,13z/) is a good place to try a *Currywurst mit Pommes*. [Konnopke's Imbiss](https://goo.gl/maps/Kh2gtdq55ccLzDQeA) is another famous place.
- **Döner kebab** - The standard street food in Berlin. The best kebab places are a secret, but the [worst kebabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/77vdgd/where_is_the_worst_kebab_in_berlin/) are usually in train stations and tourist areas.
- **Gemüse döner** (also called a chicken döner) - A döner kebab with chicken and fried vegetables. [Mustafa's](https://goo.gl/maps/RLhvoLhZNAhjABheA), [K'Ups](https://goo.gl/maps/FVVnfPsZLfYNoF5r9) and [Rüyam](https://g.page/rueyam). are some of the most famous chicken döner places.

### Typical Berlin dishes

**[Cuisine of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Berlin)** - Wikipedia

[Fleischerei Domke](https://goo.gl/maps/ZppQcDQJmj9JpyBF6) and [Englers Unikat](https://g.page/EnglersUnikat?share) have cheap, traditional working class dishes. For something fancier, try [Max und Moritz](http://www.maxundmoritzberlin.de/).

### Tipping in restaurants

Most people tip in German restaurants, but it's okay if you don't. The waiter won't be rude to you if you don't tip. German waiters don't need tips to survive, but it's a big part of their income.

**[How to tip in Germany ➞](/guides/tipping)**

## Where to stay in Berlin

There is no "downtown Berlin". There are many popular neighbourhoods, and each one has a different personality. If you stay anywhere in the *[[Ringbahn]]*, you should be okay.

[![2000Px S Bahn Ring Berlin Svg](/images/2000px-S-Bahn-Ring_Berlin.svg.png "The central parts of Berlin are inside the Ringbahn.")](/images/2000px-S-Bahn-Ring_Berlin.svg.png)

- **Hotels:** [Booking.com](http://booking.com/)
- **Hostels:** [Hostelworld](http://hostelworld.com/)
- **Vacation apartments:** [AirBnB](http://airbnb.com/) or [Wimdu](https://www.wimdu.de/)
- **Long term apartments:** see [How to find an apartment in Berlin](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)

If you are more patient, you can also use [CouchSurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com) and [BeWelcome](https://www.bewelcome.org/). People host visitors for free, and spend time with them during their visit. You can meet very interesting people like this.

## Shopping in Berlin

In Germany, **[shops and supermarkets close on Sundays](/guides/open-on-sundays-in-berlin)**. Most restaurants, tourist attractions, *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* and gas stations stay open on Sundays.

**Always have cash with you**. Some restaurants and businesses only accept cash and [Girocards](/glossary/Girocard). Most street food kiosks and *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* only accept cash. Cards are rarely accepted for small transactions.

![Berlin cash only sign](/illustrations/berlin-cash-only-sign.png)

### VAT refund

If you live outside the European Union, you can get a refund for the [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) you paid in Germany. For example, if you buy a laptop in Germany and bring it home in the United States, you can get the {{VAT_RATE}}% VAT back. It's not easy to do.

**[VAT refund process](https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/09-Taxes/vat-refund/906296)** - Federal Foreign Office

## Stay connected

If you visit from another EU country, your SIM card will also work in Germany. You make calls, send SMS and use mobile data without any extra costs.

### German power outlets

Germany has Type F power outlets. They have a voltage of 230V, and a frequency of 50Hz. Before you visit Germany, check if your devices will work there. You might need a travel adapter to charge your devices.

**[Power sockets in Germany ➞](/guides/power-sockets)**

### Free Wi-Fi in Berlin

If you don't have mobile data, you can find free Wi-Fi everywhere:

- All **U-Bahn stations** have free Wi-Fi. Look for the "BVG Free WiFi" network.
- Some **S-Bahn stations** also have free Wi-Fi. Look for the "WIFI@DB" network.
- **REWE and Lidl supermarkets** have free Wi-Fi.[^10] Some Edeka supermarkets also have free Wi-Fi.
- **Hotels and hostels** have free Wi-Fi for their guests.

[Map of public Wi-Fi hotspots](https://www.publicwifi.de/) - publicwifi.eu

### Prepaid SIM cards for tourists

You can buy a prepaid SIM card at the airport, and at Vodafone, Telekom and O2 stores. Saturn and MediaMarkt also sell and activate SIM cards. You must show your passport and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) to activate the SIM card, but store employees will just use your passport and the address of your hotel.[^11]

**[Information about SIM cards in Germany ➞](https://prepaid-data-sim-card.fandom.com/wiki/Germany)**

### Maps

[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) works really well in Berlin. If you need offline maps, use [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) or [Maps.me](https://maps.me/). Google Maps [also works offline](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform=Android&hl=en), but you can't get directions.

You should also download the [BVG app](https://www.bvg.de/en/tickets-tariffs/all-apps/ticket-app) or the [Jelbi app](https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/) to buy train tickets. It's easier than the ticket machines, and it's in English. The Jelbi app also lets you book cars, scooters, bicycles and taxis.

## Be a good tourist

### Language

**You don't need to speak German.** People in the tourism industry often speak English. If you are not sure, ask first. Museum exhibitions are in German and English. Signs in tourist areas are also in English. If you want to [live in Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin), you should [learn German](/guides/learn-german). If you are just visiting, English is fine.

**[Do I need to speak German in Berlin? ➞](/guides/learn-german#do-i-need-to-speak-german-in-berlin)**

### Tipping

In Germany, tipping is optional. In general, people tip up to 10% for good service, or round the amount on the invoice.

**[How to tip in Germany ➞](/guides/tipping)**

### Things you should not do

- **Do not walk on the bike paths**  
    Look down, and make sure you're not blocking a bicycle path. If you walk on the bike path, cyclists will ring their bell, scream at you or even bump into you.
- **Do not put your glass bottles in the trash**  
    People collect empty bottles and [return them for money](/guides/pfand-bottles). Don't make people search for bottles in the trash. Put your empty bottles next to the bin. In some parks, bottle collectors (*Flaschensammler*) will walk around and ask for your empty bottles.
- **Do not joke about Nazis and the war**  
    You probably shouldn't joke about this. It's not funny, and it's not original.

## Stay safe

### Crime

Berlin is a safe city even at night, but crimes still happen. Pickpockets steal phones and bags in trains and restaurants.

### Drugs

[Cannabis is illegal in Germany](/guides/is-marijuana-legal). You can still buy it from dealers in parks, but it's a really bad idea. You will get bad weed, and it's often contaminated with chemicals.

Magic mushrooms, cocaine and MDMA are also illegal. If you buy MDMA or ecstasy in Berlin, the [KnowDrugs](https://knowdrugs.app/en/) app can help you verify what you buy.

**[How to buy weed in Berlin ➞](/guides/buying-marijuana-in-berlin)**

### Police
