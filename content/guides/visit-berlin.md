## How to travel to Berlin

### By plane

Fly to the [Berlin Brandenburg airport](https://goo.gl/maps/iERwxpTUr7EnYFnKA). Use [Kayak](https://www.kayak.de/?ispredir=true), [Omio](/out/omio), [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) or [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) to book your flight.

To get from the airport to the city, you can...

- **Use [public transit](/guides/public-transit)** (recommended)  
    Take a train from BER airport to Berlin. It takes 30 to 45 minutes. Use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/BER+Airport+-+Terminal+1-2/@52.3647378,13.5089418,16.66z) or [BVG Fahrinfo](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps/fahrinfo-app). The airport is in zone C, so you must buy an ABC ticket. The ticket costs {{BVG_ABC_TICKET|cur}}€. You can buy tickets at the airport, near the train platform. You can pay with cash or a credit card.[^2] [Validate](/guides/public-transit#step-2-validate-your-ticket) your ticket before you get on the train. - [How to use public transit](/guides/public-transit)
- **Take a taxi**  
    There are taxis outside the BER airport. A ride from the airport to the city centre costs at least 50€.[^3] You can also book a taxi with [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/airports/ber/) or [FreeNow](https://www.free-now.com/de/flughafen). You can pay with cash or a credit card.[^4]
- **Rent a car**  
    You can rent a car at the airport. There are kiosks for different car rental companies. You can also rent a [Miles](https://miles-mobility.com/en-de/car-sharing/berlin) car.

### By intercity bus

Intercity buses are often cheaper than planes or trains. Use [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/) or [Omio](/out/omio) to buy bus tickets. Some buses let you bring a bicycle.

Most buses have free Wi-Fi, power outlets and a small toilet.

Most intercity buses arrive at...

- [Berlin Brandenburg airport](https://goo.gl/maps/iERwxpTUr7EnYFnKA), 45 minutes from the centre
- [Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof](https://goo.gl/maps/m5e93UyQamw4YvDY6) (ZOB), 25 minutes from the centre
- [Alexanderplatz](https://goo.gl/maps/Mg5nKPhJzAS7fLNdA), in the centre

If you arrive at BER airport, you need an [ABC train ticket](/guides/public-transit#tariff-zones) to get to Berlin. It costs {{BVG_ABC_TICKET|cur}}€.

### By train

Intercity trains are more comfortable, but also more expensive. They arrive directly in the city centre. Most trains have free Wi-Fi, but it's often unreliable. Some trains let you bring a bicycle.

Most trains stop at the central train station, [Berlin Hauptbahnhof](https://goo.gl/maps/yXUBcBH9cGnx1dP46). This is in the middle of Berlin.

Use [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/), [Omio](/out/omio), [Bahn.de](/out/bahn) or [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) to find a train route. To pay less, use the [Super Saver Fare](https://www.bahn.com/en/offers/super-saver-fare) or book your tickets long in advance.

### By car or motorcycle

You can drive in Germany with a foreign driving licence. You might need a translation or an International Driving Permit.

**[Who can drive in Germany ➞](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence#can-you-already-drive-in-germany)**

Driving in Berlin is easy, but free parking is hard to find.

Most parking spaces in the centre cost 1€ to 4€ per hour.[^6] Use [Parkopedia](https://www.parkopedia.com) to find a free or paid parking space. Most parking spaces outside of the central neighbourhoods are free. [Motorcycles can park on the sidewalk](/guides/motorcycle-parking) for free.

You can also park outside the city and take the train to Berlin. There are free [Park and Ride (P+R) car parks](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1lfZOUDUCPL1UgzHwGptdyyfhwEk). You can park your car there for free, and take the train to Berlin. You can find them on [this map](https://www.vbb.de/en/vbb-travel-info/) (in Multi-mobility), or with [this list](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/car-parks).

The area inside the *[[Ringbahn]]* is an [environmental zone](https://www.berlin.de/en/tourism/travel-information/1760452-2862820-environmental-zone.en.html). You need a [green environmental sticker](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-environmental-zone) to drive in this area. You can get a green sticker at most gas stations around Berlin. Motorcycles don't need a green sticker to enter this zone.

**[Information about the environmental zone](https://www.berlin.de/en/tourism/travel-information/1760452-2862820-environmental-zone.en.html)** - Berlin.de

### By car sharing

[BlaBlaCar](/out/blablacar) lets you ride with drivers who travel to Berlin. You meet them in one place, and drive together to another city. Car sharing is usually cheaper and faster than intercity buses, but it takes more planning.

## How to get around in Berlin

### How to find your way around Berlin

[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) works really well in Berlin. It also works offline. The [BVG app](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps) and the [Jelbi app](https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/) let you see train schedules and buy train tickets, but they don't work offline. [Maps.me](https://maps.me/) and [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) have offline maps and directions.

### How to use public transit in Berlin

Berlin has very good public transit. It's the best way to get around, even when you have a car. Just make sure you [buy the right ticket](/guides/public-transit#step-1-buy-a-ticket) and [validate it](/guides/public-transit#step-2-validate-your-ticket). If you are caught with the wrong ticket, you will get a [{{BVG_FINE|cur}}€ fine](/guides/paying-a-bvg-fine).

You can buy a 24 hour, 7 day or 1 month ticket. It's cheaper than buying a ticket every time. There's also the [WelcomeCard](https://www.berlin-welcomecard.de/en), a ticket that gives you rebates on museums and attractions.

**[How to use public transit ➞](/guides/public-transit)**

### How to rent a bicycle or a scooter

**This is the best way to see Berlin**. Berlin is very flat and has a lot of bike paths, so it's easy to ride a bicycle or a scooter. You can rent them for around 10€ per day.

When I have visitors, this is my favourite way to show Berlin. I take my visitors along the river Spree and the Landwehrkanal.

**[Where to rent a bicycle ➞](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin#renting-a-bicycle)**

**[Where to rent an electric scooter ➞](/guides/public-transit#rent-a-scooter)**

### How to rent a car

You don't need to rent a car in Berlin. It's easier to use public transit. If you have an International Driving Permit or a EU driver's licence, you can drive in Germany.

- **[Teufelsberg](https://goo.gl/maps/2FeB6UnVv4LohpQR9)**  
    Teufelsberg is an artificial hill. There is a cold war listening station at the top. It's now an open air gallery with a really good view of Berlin. If you don't want to pay to visit Teufelsberg, you can visit Drachenberg, the other hill next to it.

### Walking tours

Guided tours are a great way to discover Berlin. Use [GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/s/?q=Berlin,%20Germany) or [Airbnb experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Berlin--Germany/experiences) to find walking tours, or look at [this list](https://www.visitberlin.de/en/guided-walking-tour-berlin). I recommend the [Berliner Unterwelten](https://www.berliner-unterwelten.de/en/index.html) tours.

### Outside of Berlin

If you have a bit more time, **[Potsdam](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Potsdam)** and **[Wannsee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wannsee,+Berlin/@52.4197082,13.1025382,13z/)** are worth seeing. You can get there by train. Potsdam is in [zone C](/guides/public-transit#tariff-zones), so you need an ABC ticket.

In the last week of April, you can also see the [Baumblütenfest](https://www.baumbluetenfest.de/) in Werder. It's one of the largest folk festivals in [[Brandenburg]].

### Clubs in Berlin

Berlin is famous for its techno clubs. It can be hard to get into certain clubs. Clubs don't let everyone in. For example, they often reject tourists, big groups, drunk people, and people under 21 years old.[^7]

In Berlin, people don't wear fancy clothes to go clubbing. If you dress too nice, you won't get in.[^8] Each club has its own unofficial dress code. Ask the locals what the dress code is.

Most clubs have a cover charge. You must pay 5€ to 25€ to get in. Clubs in Berlin stay open all night. The party starts late, and the busiest time is around 2AM. You can buy presale tickets for club events on [Resident Advisor](https://ra.co/guide/de/berlin). When you have tickets, it's easier to get in.[^9] If you don't get in, you get your money back.[^5]

Find club events on [Resident Advisor](https://ra.co/guide/de/berlin), or follow clubs on Facebook and Instagram.

## What to eat in Berlin

### Typical Berlin street food

- **[Currywurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currywurst)**  
    A pork sausage with a curry and ketchup sauce. It's usually served with fries (*mit Pommes*) in a cardboard plate. [Curry 36](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Curry+36/@52.540513,13.3772295,13z/) and [Konnopke's Imbiss](https://maps.app.goo.gl/my1KakAy5AnCKgJo9) are two famous options.
- **Döner kebab**  
    The standard street food in Berlin. The best kebab places are a secret, but the [worst kebabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/77vdgd/where_is_the_worst_kebab_in_berlin/) are usually in train stations and tourist areas.
- **Gemüse Döner** (or chicken Döner)  
    A Döner kebab with chicken and fried vegetables. [Mustafa's](https://goo.gl/maps/RLhvoLhZNAhjABheA) and [Rüyam](https://g.page/rueyam) are some of the most famous chicken Döner places. I like [K'Ups](https://goo.gl/maps/FVVnfPsZLfYNoF5r9) and [Superhahn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ph8hMNRE3JtpvTbB6).

### Typical Berlin dishes

**[Cuisine of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Berlin)** - Wikipedia

[Fleischerei Domke](https://goo.gl/maps/ZppQcDQJmj9JpyBF6) and [Englers Unikat](https://g.page/EnglersUnikat?share) have cheap, traditional working class dishes. For something fancier, try [Max und Moritz](https://maxundmoritzberlin.de/).

### Tipping in restaurants

Most people tip in German restaurants, but it's okay if you don't. The waiter won't be rude to you if you don't tip. German waiters don't need tips to survive, but it's a big part of their income.

**[How to tip in Germany ➞](/guides/tipping)**

## Where to stay in Berlin

There is no "down town Berlin". There are many popular neighbourhoods, and each one has a different personality. If you stay anywhere in the *[[Ringbahn]]*, you should be okay.

[![2000Px S Bahn Ring Berlin Svg](/images/2000px-S-Bahn-Ring_Berlin.svg.png "The central parts of Berlin are inside the Ringbahn.")](/images/2000px-S-Bahn-Ring_Berlin.svg.png)

- **Hotels:** [Booking.com](https://booking.com/)
- **Hostels:** [Hostelworld](https://www.hostelworld.com/)
- **Vacation apartments:** [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) or [Wimdu](https://www.wimdu.de/)
- **Long term apartments:** see [How to find an apartment in Berlin](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)

If you are more patient, you can also use [CouchSurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com) and [BeWelcome](https://www.bewelcome.org/). People host visitors for free, and spend time with them during their visit.

## Shopping in Berlin

### You need cash

Germans pay with cash, Girocard, Visa and Mastercard. **Always have cash with you**. Many restaurants only accept cash. Most street food kiosks and *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* only accept cash.

**[Payment methods in Germany ➞](/guides/banking#common-payment-methods)**

![Sign that says "Cash only"](/illustrations/berlin-cash-only-sign.png)

### Shops close on sundays

In Germany, shops and supermarkets close on Sundays. Most restaurants, tourist attractions, *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* and gas stations stay open on Sundays.

**[What stays open on Sundays ➞](/guides/open-on-sundays-in-berlin)**

### VAT refund

If you live outside the [[European Union]], you can get a refund for the [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) you paid in Germany. For example, if you buy a laptop in Germany and bring it home in the United States, you can get the {{VAT_RATE}}% VAT back. It's not easy to do.

**[VAT refund process](https://www.germany.info/us-en/service/09-Taxes/vat-refund/906296)** - Federal Foreign Office

## Stay connected

If you visit from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country, your EU SIM card will also work in Germany. You make calls, send SMS and use mobile data without any extra costs.

### German power outlets

Germany has Type F power outlets. They have a voltage of 230V, and a frequency of 50Hz. Before you visit Germany, check if your devices will work there. You might need a travel adapter to charge your devices.

**[Power sockets in Germany ➞](/guides/power-sockets)**

### Free Wi-Fi in Berlin

If you don't have mobile data, you can find free Wi-Fi everywhere:

- All **U-Bahn stations** have free Wi-Fi. Look for the "BVG Free WiFi" network.
- Some **S-Bahn stations** also have free Wi-Fi. Look for the "WIFI@DB" network.
- All **trams** have free Wi-Fi. Look for the "BVG Free WiFi" network.
- **REWE and Lidl supermarkets** have free Wi-Fi.[^10] Some Edeka supermarkets also have free Wi-Fi.
- **Hotels and hostels** have free Wi-Fi for their guests.

**[Map of public Wi-Fi hotspots ➞](https://www.publicwifi.de/)**

### Prepaid SIM cards for tourists

If you want mobile data while you visit Berlin, you should get a temporary SIM card.

There are 3 ways to buy a SIM card:

- **Buy a digital SIM card** (eSIM){% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    This is the cheapest and easiest way. I use it all the time. You buy an eSIM from [Airalo](/out/airalo), and activate it when you arrive in Berlin. Your phone must support eSIMs.
- **Get a SIM card at a mobile phone shop**  
    Buy a SIM card from a Vodafone, Telekom or O2 shop. Electronics stores like Saturn or MediaMarkt also sell and activate SIM cards. You must show your passport and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) to activate the SIM card, but store employees will just use your passport and the address of your hotel.[^11]
- **Get a SIM card at the airport**  
    [The Wall Store](https://ber.berlin-airport.de/de/cafes-shops-service/sgs-poi/055-the-wall-store-berlin-t1.html) and [Travelex](https://ber.berlin-airport.de/de/cafes-shops-service/sgs-poi/069-travelex-t1.html) sell SIM cards at the Berlin. The Wall's SIM cards are much cheaper than Travelex. There is often a long queue to buy them, so [Airalo](/out/airalo) is much easier.

![The Wall Store at Berlin airport](/images/the-wall-store-berlin-airport.jpg "The Wall Store at Berlin airport sells SIM cards, but they are too expensive.")

![Travelex at Berlin airport](/images/travelex-berlin-airport.jpg "Travelex at Berlin airport sells SIM cards, but they are too expensive.")

### Maps

[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) works really well in Berlin. If you need offline maps, use [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) or [Maps.me](https://maps.me/). Google Maps [also works offline](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform=Android&hl=en), but you can't get directions.

For more accurate public transport directions, get the [BVG app](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps/ticket-app).

To buy public transport tickets, get the [BVG app](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps/ticket-app) or the [Jelbi app](https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/) to buy train tickets. They have more accurate train schedules. It's easier than the ticket machines, and it's in English. The Jelbi app also lets you book cars, scooters, bicycles and taxis.

## Be a good tourist

### Language

**You don't need to speak German.** People in the tourism industry often speak English. If you are not sure, ask first. Museum exhibitions are in German and English. Signs in tourist areas are also in English. If you want to [live in Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin), you should [learn German](/guides/learn-german). If you are just visiting, English is fine.

**[Do I need to speak German in Berlin? ➞](/guides/learn-german#do-i-need-to-speak-german-in-berlin)**

### Tipping

In Germany, tipping is optional. In general, people tip up to 10% for good service, or round the amount on the invoice.

**[How to tip in Germany ➞](/guides/tipping)**

### Things you should not do

- **Do not walk on the bike paths**  
    The bicycle path is usually a 1 meter wide red brick path on the sidewalk. If you walk on the bike path, cyclists will ring their bell, shout at you or even bump into you.
- **Do not put your glass bottles in the trash**  
    People collect empty bottles and [return them for money](/guides/pfand-bottles). Don't make people search for bottles in the trash. Put your empty bottles next to the bin. In some parks, bottle collectors (*Flaschensammler*) will walk around and ask for your empty bottles.
- **Do not joke about Nazis and the war**  
    You probably shouldn't joke about this. It's not funny, and it's not original.

## Stay safe

### Crime

Berlin is a safe city even at night, but crimes still happen. Pickpockets steal phones and bags in trains and restaurants.

### Drugs

[Cannabis is illegal in Germany](/guides/is-marijuana-legal). You can still buy it from dealers in parks, but it's a really bad idea. You will get bad weed, and it's often contaminated with chemicals.

Magic mushrooms, cocaine and MDMA are also illegal. If you buy MDMA or ecstasy in Berlin, the [KnowDrugs](https://knowdrugs.app/) app can help you verify what you buy.
