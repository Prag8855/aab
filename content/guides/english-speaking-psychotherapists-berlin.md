## Psychiatrist, psychotherapist or counsellor?

**Psychiatrists** solve mental health problems with medical treatments. They are doctors who studied medicine. They can diagnose mental health problems and prescribe medication. Some can also give therapy.[^1]

**[English-speaking psychiatrists in Berlin ➞](/guides/english-speaking-psychiatrists-berlin)**

**Psychotherapists** solve mental health problems with therapy. They studied psychotherapy. They can diagnose mental health problems and give therapy. They can't prescribe medication.[^2]

**Counsellors** have no specific qualifications. There are no standards for being a counsellor, because it's not a protected title.[^4] They can't diagnose mental health problems or give therapy. Many therapists who move to Germany call themselves counsellors because their diplomas are not recognised in Germany. - [More information](https://blog.complicated.life/a-practitioners-guide-to-understanding-what-psychotherapy-and-counselling-means-to-your-work-in-private-practice/)

**Alternative practitioner for psychotherapy** (*Heilpraktiker für Psychotherapie*) do not have the same qualifications or audits as psychotherapists. Many of them were licenced as psychotherapists in other countries before they moved to Germany. They can't diagnose mental health problems or treat addictions.

## How hard is it to find a psychotherapist?

**It's very hard.**  If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), it's harder, because many therapists only accept private health insurance and self-pay.[^0] Many therapists are too busy, and don't accept new clients. If you are lucky, it takes a week. If you are not lucky, it can take months.

## How much does psychotherapy cost?

In Berlin, it costs around 100€ per hour.[^0] Group therapy is usually cheaper.

**If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**, find a therapist that accepts public insurance. Your insurance will cover the therapy. You don't have to pay anything.

**If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**, your insurance will usually refund the costs. Check with your health insurer first, just to be sure.

**If you are a student**, you can also get free therapy [from your *Studentenwerk*](https://www.stw.berlin/en/counselling.html#jump_psychological_counselling).
