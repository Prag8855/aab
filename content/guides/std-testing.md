### Does German health insurance cover STI tests?

**Sometimes**. If you have symptoms, the test is usually covered. Routine tests are rarely covered.

- **If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Public health insurance only pays for the test if you have symptoms, or a good reason to think you are infected.[^3] It does not pay for routine tests. Women under 26 years old can get one free Chlamydia test per year.[^4] Some people lie to get the test covered by their health insurance.[^5]
- **If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Some private health insurances pay for STI tests. You pay for the test yourself, and your insurance sometimes reimburse you. It depends on the insurance policy. Ask your private health insurer.
- **If you have travel or [expat insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    STI tests are almost never covered. Some insurances include a €300 per year budget for tests and check-ups.
