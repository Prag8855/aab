This is a list of foreign cooking ingredients, and where to find them in Berlin. If something is missing, [let me know](/impressum#contact-information).

If you can't find something, ask [Found in... Berlin](https://www.facebook.com/groups/530673463736983/).

## List of ingredients

### Almond flour

You can find almond flour at DM and Rossman[^0].

### American cheese

American cheese, the square, "radioactive yellow" cheese that's also known as Kraft Singles, can be found in the dairy section of most grocery stores.

### Baking soda

Sodium bicarbonate is called *Natron* in Germany. It's sold in small paper packets and boxes. You can find it in the baking section of all grocery stores. Look for the green [Kaiser Natron boxes](http://amzn.to/2ysUzPG) and [packets](https://www.amazon.de/Holste-Kaiser-Natron-50-g/dp/B00HL731VU/). You can find Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda at some Asian grocery stores like [Asia24 near Rathaus Steglitz](https://g.page/asia24-asien-supermarkt?share).

### Baking powder

Baking powder is called *Backpulver* in Germany. It's easy to find. Look for [small paper packets](http://amzn.to/2wkUDAu) in the baking section of any grocery store. German baking powder is usually single-acting, while American and English baking powder is double-acting, and [the difference is important](https://www.thoughtco.com/double-and-single-acting-baking-powder-3975954). [Broken English](http://www.brokenenglish.de/) and many Asian markets have double-acting baking powder. If you are in a pinch, substitute double-acting baking powder with 1.25x the amount single-acting baking powder.

### Boneless chicken thighs

This is not a common product in Germany[^1], but Metro has them, and sometimes Penny.

### Brown sugar

German *Rohrzucker* or *brauner Zucker* is not the same as brown sugar. It does not contain molasses, and it will ruin any recipe that calls for brown sugar. Tate+Lyle sells light and dark brown sugar on Amazon. You can also find it in most asian supermarkets. Go Asia, [Asia Markt Lee](https://goo.gl/maps/uzoxjmVLAccNgFJv9), [Metro](https://www.metro.de/), Galeria Kaufhof and some Edeka stores have brown sugar. You can also make it yourself with sugar and molasses.

### Caramelized condensed milk

[LEDO supermarkets](https://www.ledo-supermarkt.de/) have caramelized condensed milk, and many other Russian staple foods.

### Chipotles

[Chili &amp; Paprika](http://www.chiliundpaprika.de/) has chipotles.

### Chorizo

[Chili &amp; Paprika](http://www.chiliundpaprika.de/) has chorizo.

### Condensed milk

Condensed milk is called *Kondensmilch*. You can find it in the coffee section[^2], next to coffee cream and H-Milch. It's sold in small cans, or in small juice boxes.

Condensed milk can be a false friend for people from the UK at least. If a recipe calls for condensed milk, you might want *gezuckert Kondensmilch*, also known as *Mädchenmilch*.

### Corn tortillas

Corn tortillas are sold at [Super Iberico](https://www.facebook.com/superibericoberlin/), [Chili &amp; Paprika](http://www.chiliundpaprika.de/) and [Aqui España](http://aqui-espana.de/). [Cintli](https://www.cintli.de/) also sells them [in different stores](https://www.cintli.de/kontakt).

### Couscous spices

According to Quora, you can find Couscous spice at Galeria under the name *Ras el-Hanout*. Turkish markets and spice kiosks at Berlin's many [Wochenmärkte](http://www.mein-wochenmarkt.com/berlin/) should also carry couscous spices.

### Evaporated milk

See *Condensed milk*.

### Flour

North American all-purpose flour is the same as Type 550 flour in Germany. It's in most supermarkets. [Mehlstübchen](https://www.mehlstuebchen.de/) has flours from all over the world, including Manitoba and type 00 *dopio zero*. Self-raising flour can be found at Galeria Kaufhof.

### Graham crumbs

Graham crumbs are hard to find, but if you grind [Leibniz crackers](http://amzn.to/2yBu6iZ) into crumbs, it's exactly the same. You can find them in every supermarket.

### Hot dog sausages

Most Turkish grocery stores have chicken and beef sausages. They taste exactly like the hot dog sausages in North America.

### Kerrygold salted butter

Edeka, Lidl, Penny and [REWE](https://www.rewe.de/suche/?search=kerrygold) usually have Kerrygold salted butter.

### Maple syrup

Most grocery stores have pure Canadian or American maple syrup. REWE keeps it close the the Nutella and peanut butter.

### Marmite

Marmite is found at Galeria Kaufhof and Broken English. It was also spotted at [Asia Mekong](https://sites.google.com/site/asiamekongsupermarket/Home) near Hackescher Markt and in the English section at Real,- and at KaDeWe[^3].

### Minced lamb

You can find it in Turkish supermarkets like Bolu or Eurogida. Find them with [this map](https://turkischersupermarkt.de/explore/). Regular supermarkets and butcher shops do not sell it.

### Molasses

Molasses is called *Melasse* in German. You can find it at Edeka and in many bio shops. You can also [order it off Amazon](http://amzn.to/2ylsw93).

### Mustard powder

This staple ingredient of American BBQ can be found in most [Wochenmärkte](http://www.mein-wochenmarkt.com/berlin/). I get mine from the Winterfeldtplatz market. Just look for *Senfpulver* at the spice kiosks. Colman's Mustard Powder can be found at KaDeWe or ordered [from Amazon](http://amzn.to/2xNSFdr).

### Pancetta

Italian pancetta can be found at KaDeWe.

### Peanut butter

Most grocery stores carry peanut butter. REWE has both creamy and crunchy peanut butter. You will find it next to the Nutella. Go Asia has Skippy peanut butter.

### Powdered sugar

Powdered sugar (also called confectioner's sugar or icing sugar) is called *Puderzucker* or *Staubzucker*. It's sold in [small boxes](http://amzn.to/2fQyuDJ) in the baking section of all grocery stores. It's very easy to find. [There is a small difference](https://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/sugar.htm) between powdered sugar and confectioner's sugar. If you need confectioner's sugar, add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch per cup of powdered sugar.

### Pumpkin puree

KaDeWe and Galeria Kaufhof sell [Libby's](https://www.verybestbaking.com/libbys) pumpkin puree. [American Lifestyle](http://www.us-shop-berlin.de/Libbys-100-Pure-Pumpkin-425-g) also has pumpkin puree. You can also [make your own](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/22935/pumpkin-puree/).

### Sal de Guzano, sal de Chapulín

[Chili &amp; Paprika](http://www.chiliundpaprika.de/) has agave worm salt and grasshoper salt.

### Self-raising flour

You can get it from most Asian supermarkets, and at Galeria Kaufhof. You can make your own: add 2 teaspoons of baking powder for every 150g of flour.

### Vanilla extract

Vanilla extract hard to find in Germany. I buy it [on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2hzkheJ). Galeria Kaufhof, [Chili &amp; Paprika](http://www.chiliundpaprika.de/), Edeka and [Metro](https://www.metro.de/) also sell it.

### Vegemite

[Australia Shopping World](http://www.australiashop.com/) has Vegemite. You can also [order it from Amazon](http://amzn.to/2yhOt8K), but it's expensive.

### Yeast

Yeast is called *Backhefe* in Germany. You can find it in [small paper packets](http://amzn.to/2wjxbUd) in the baking section of all grocery stores.
