## Who can drive in Germany?

You can drive in Germany with a foreign driving licence.

- **With a EU or EEA driving licence**
    - **If you visit Germany**: You can drive in Germany. You don't need an [International Driving Permit](/glossary/Internationaler%20F%C3%BChrerschein).[^0]
    - **If you live in Germany**: You can drive in Germany until your licence expires.[^1] You don't need a translation or an [International Driving Permit](/glossary/Internationaler%20F%C3%BChrerschein).[^0]
- **With a driving licence from Andorra, Hong Kong, Monaco, New Zealand, San Marino, Senegal or Switzerland**
    - **If you visit Germany**: You can drive in Germany. You don't need a translation or an [International Driving Permit](/glossary/Internationaler%20F%C3%BChrerschein).[^0]
    - **If you live in Germany**: You can drive in Germany for 6 months after you move there.[^2] After 6 months, you must exchange you foreign driving licence for a German one.
- **With a driving licence from any other country**
    - **If you visit Germany:** You can drive in Germany. If you have a learner's licence, it's not valid in Germany.[^0]
    - **If you live in Germany:** You can drive in Germany for 6 months after you move there.[^0] After 6 months, you must have a German driving licence. In some cases, you can exchange you foreign driving licence for a German one. In other cases, you must [take driving lessons](/guides/english-driving-schools-in-berlin) to get a German driving licence.

### Driving licence translations

You must carry a translation of your driving licence if:

- Your driving licence is not from a EU or [[EEA]] country
- **and** your driving licence is not in German

There are some exceptions. Check with your country's automobile association.

There are two ways to get a driving licence translation:

- **Get an [International Driving Permit](/glossary/Internationaler%20F%C3%BChrerschein)**
    - In the United States: from the AAA or AATA.[^3] You can apply by post.
    - In Canada: from a CAA Travel Centre,[^4] a vehicle registration office (like the SAAQ), or a Canadian embassy or consulate.[^5]
    - In the UK: at the Post Office
- or **get a [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung)**...
    - from a certified translator like [LingoKing](/out/lingoking-drivers-licence)
    - or from a government office like an embassy or [vehicle registration office](/glossary/Kfz-Zulassungsstelle)
    - or from a recognised automobile association like [AA](https://www.theaa.com/), [AAA](https://www.aaa.com/International/), [CAA](https://www.caa.ca/), [ADAC](https://www.adac.de/)...

## Who can convert their driving licence?

You can exchange driving licences from certain countries for a German one. In some cases, you might need to take an eye test, a first aid courses, a driving exam, or even some driving classes. Each country has different rules. Even different states or provinces have different rules.

If your country is not listed, you can't convert your driving licence.

## How to convert your licence to a German one

**You must have received your original driver license before you moved to Germany**.[^6] You can't move to Germany, get a foreign driver license, then exchange it for a German one. You can't get a driver licence in another European Union country while you live in Germany.

I renewed my Canadian driver licence *after* I moved to Germany, so the date on my licence was after my [address registration](/glossary/Anmeldung) date. I needed to prove that I got my Canadian licence before moving to Germany. I showed photocopies of my old Canadian licence, and a certificate from my driving school in Canada.

**You can wait more than 6 months to exchange your driver licence**.[^7] If you moved to Germany more than 6 months ago, you can still exchange your foreign licence for a German one. I applied more than 1 year after I moved to Germany, and it was not a problem.

### 1. Register your address

You must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) (*[[Anmeldung]]*), because you need a registration certificate (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*) to convert your driving licence.

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

**[How to get a registration certificate ➞](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung)**

After this, the rules depend on which country your licence is from. See the [requirements for each country](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html).

### 2. Check the requirements for your country

You can exchange driving licences from certain countries for a German one. In some cases, you might need to take an eye test, a first aid courses, a driving exam, or even some driving classes. **Each country has different rules**. Even different states or provinces have different rules.

### 3. Take a first aid course

If required, take a first aid course. This takes around 2 hours. In Berlin, you can even [do it in English](https://www.first-aid-course-english-berlin.com/dates-places?utm_source=allaboutberlin). It costs around 60€.[^8]

### 4. Take an eye test

If required, get an eye test (*Sehtest*). You can get a [free eye test at Fielmann](https://www.fielmann.de/service/fuehrerschein-sehtest/). You can sometimes get an eye test where you get your first aid class.

### 5. Take driving lessons

If required, get driving lessons. Sometimes you must only take theory classes, and sometimes you must also take driving lessons with a car.

Sometimes, you only need to take a driving test. If you are Canadian or American, you should take driving lessons, even if they are not required. The driving rules are *very* different in Europe, and you are not prepared to drive here.

### 6. Get a Bürgeramt appointment

[Book an appointment](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/327537/) at the *[[Bürgeramt]]* for a driving license transfer (*[Umschreibung einer ausländischen Fahrerlaubnis](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/327537/)*). In Berlin, it's hard to find an appointment. The nearest appointment could be in a few weeks.

### 7. Go to your appointment

Go to your appointment, and bring all the [required documents](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/327537/):

- **Foreign driving licence**  
    It must still be valid. You must bring the original licence, not just a copy. During the appointment, you give your driving licence and never get it back.
- **Photocopy of your driving licence**
- **Passport or personal ID**
- **[Certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung) of your driving licence**  
    If your driving licence is not in English or German, you need a certified translation. You can get one from [Lingoking](/out/lingoking-drivers-licence) or [ADAC](https://www.adac.de/) for around 50€. International Driving Permits are also accepted.
- **A passport photo**. You can [get new passport pictures](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin) for around 6€.
- **An EC card or cash** to pay the fees (36.30€). Visa and MasterCard are sometimes accepted.[^9]
- **[[Anmeldebestätigung]]** to prove that you live in Berlin. It's not always required.

The appointment itself only takes a few minutes, and it costs 36.30€.[^13] The *[[Bürgeramt]]* will send your documents to the *Fahrerlaubnisbehörde*, and they will verify them with your country's embassy.

During your appointment, you should **ask for a temporary license** while you wait for your German driving license.[^14]

### 8. Wait

**This can take a long time**. In Berlin, you must wait around 6 weeks to exchange a driver's license. Some people wait much longer.[^10] In 2016, it took me 14 weeks. In smaller cities, it takes 2 to 6 weeks.[^15]

**[Current processing times in Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/labo/mobilitaet/aktuelles/aktuelle-bearbeitungsstaende-736453.php)** - This is the time it takes before they *start* working on your application. It will take a few more weeks after that.

One Canadian got his license faster when the Canadian embassy told the *Fahrerlaubnisbehörde* to hurry up.[^14]

### 9. Pick up your German driving licence

In a few weeks, you will get a letter. It will tell you to get your new driver license from the *Fahrerlaubnisbehörde*. Go there, take a number, wait your turn, show them your passport and get your license. It's very easy, but you might wait 30 to 60 minutes.[^16]

Sometimes, your licence is ready, but they don't tell you to pick it up.[^12] If you do not get any news after 8 weeks, call the *Fahrerlaubnisbehörde*, and ask about your license.

## What to do next

Now that you have a German driving licence, you can [buy a car](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany) and [use car sharing services](/guides/public-transit#rent-a-car).

If this is the first time you drive in Europe, read Route to Germany's [guide to driving in Germany](https://routetogermany.com/).
