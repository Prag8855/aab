{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Can you already drive in Germany?

### If you visit Germany

**You can drive during your visit.** Your foreign driving licence is valid in Germany.[^11] If you have a motorcycle licence, you can ride a motorcycle. Temporary licences and learner's permits are not valid.[^1]

You usually need a translation of your driving licence. There are two ways to get a translation:

- **Get an [International Driving Permit](/glossary/Internationaler%20F%C3%BChrerschein)**
    - United Kingdom: at the Post Office
    - United States: from the AAA or AATA.[^3] You can apply by post.
    - Canada: from a CAA Travel Centre,[^4] a vehicle registration office (like the SAAQ), or a Canadian embassy or consulate.[^5]
- or **get a [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung)**...
    - from a certified translator like [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [LingoKing](/out/lingoking-drivers-licence)
    - or from your country's embassy or [vehicle registration office](/glossary/Kfz-Zulassungsstelle)
    - or from a recognised automobile association like [ADAC](https://www.adac.de/) (Germany), [AA](https://www.theaa.com/) (UK), [AAA](https://www.aaa.com/International/) (US) or [CAA](https://www.caa.ca/) (Canada).

You **don't** need a driving licence translation if...[^0]

- Your driving licence is from the EU, [[EEA]], Andorra, Hong Kong, Monaco, New Zealand, San Marino, Senegal or Switzerland.
- or it follows [these rules](https://www.international-driving-permit.com/Convention-on-Road-Traffic/8-November-1968/EN/Annexex/Annex-6-Domestic-Driving-Permit.aspx) (Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, Annex 6)
- or it's in German

### If you live in Germany

After you move to Germany, your foreign driving licence is valid for 6 months.[^18] If you have a EU or [[EEA]] driving licence, it's valid until it expires.[^17]

When your driving licence becomes invalid, you can...

- Convert your foreign driving licence to a German driving licence
- or [take driving lessons](/guides/english-driving-schools-in-berlin), pass the driving exam, and get a new driving licence

## How to convert your driving licence

### Basic requirements

You can convert **driving licences from any other country**. You can do this **anytime after you move to Germany**.[^7] I applied over 1 year after my *[[Anmeldung]]*.

You can't always convert truck or motorcycle licences. It depends on the country it comes from. For example, you can't a Canadian motorcycle licence. This is not a problem with EU and [[EEA]] driving licences.

You can convert an expired EU or [[EEA]] driving licence.[^8] You can't convert an expired driving licence from other countries.[^6] You can't convert a temporary licence or a learner's permit.

You must get your foreign driving licence before you move to Germany. You can't move to Germany, get a driving licence elsewhere, then convert it.

I renewed my Canadian licence after I moved to Berlin. The date on the driving licence was after my *[[Anmeldung]]* date. I had to prove that I got my driving licence before I moving to Germany. I showed photocopies of my old Canadian licence, and a certificate from my Canadian driving school.

### 1. Register your address

Register your address (*[[Anmeldung]]*) first. You need a registration certificate (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*) to convert your driving licence.

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

**[How to get a registration certificate ➞](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung)**

### 2. Check the requirements for your country

Where did you get your driving licence? The requirements are different for each country.

- **EU and [[EEA]] countries**  
    You don't need to take any exam, test or course.[^20]
- **[Annex 11 countries](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html)**
    - [ ] Pass a theoretical driving exam (only for [some countries](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html))
    - [ ] Pass a practical driving exam (only for [some countries](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html))
- **Other countries**
    - [ ] [Take a first aid course](#take-a-first-aid-course)
    - [ ] [Get an eye test](#get-an-eye-test)
    - [ ] Pass a theoretical driving exam
    - [ ] Pass a practical driving exam

### 3. Take a first aid course

If your licence is not from an EU, [[EEA]] or [Annex 11](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html) country, you must take a first aid course (*Erste-Hilfe-Kurs*). It takes around **9 hours** and costs around **70€**.[^12]

Where to take a first aid course in English:

- [Fahrschule Oscar](https://first-aid-courses-berlin.myshopify.com/collections/fahrschule-oscar)
- [German Red Cross](https://www.drk-berlin-zentrum.de/angebote/kurse-in-erster-hilfe/first-aid-in-english.html)
- [Erste Hilfe Station](https://www.first-aid-course-english-berlin.com/dates-places)

### 4. Get an eye test

If your licence is not from an EU, [[EEA]] or [Annex 11](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html) country, you must get an eye test (*Sehtest*). It takes **a few minutes** and costs **less than 10€**.

Where to get an eye test:

- At the optometrist (*[[Optiker]]*). Fielmann gives [free eye tests](https://www.fielmann.de/service/fuehrerschein-sehtest/).
- During your first aid course. Some first aid schools give eye tests.[^16]

### 5. Take driving lessons

Driving lessons are **optional**, but they are a really good idea. If you come from North America, the rules here are completely different. You are not ready to drive in Germany.

**[English-speaking driving schools in Berlin ➞](/guides/english-driving-schools-in-berlin)**

If you don't take driving lessons, read Route to Germany's [guide to driving in Germany](https://routetogermany.com/).

### 6. Get a Bürgeramt appointment

Book a *[[Bürgeramt]]* appointment. In Berlin, appointments are hard to find. The nearest appointment could be in a few weeks.

**[Book an appointment](/out/appointment-convert-driving-licence-eu)** (EU or EEA driving licence)

**[Book an appointment](https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/termin/all/327537/)** (Annex 11 and other countries)

### 7. Go to your appointment

Go to your *Bürgeramt* appointment, and bring all the [required documents](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/327537/):

- [ ] **Foreign driving licence**  
    Bring the original licence, not a copy. If it's not a EU or [[EEA]] licence, it must still be valid.[^6] During the appointment, they take your driving licence. You don't get it back.
- [ ] **Photocopy of your driving licence**
- [ ] **Passport or personal ID**
- [ ] **Passport photo**  
    You can [get new passport pictures](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin) for around 6€.
- [ ] **Registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)  
    This proves that you live in Berlin. Other proofs of residence might be accepted.[^2]
- [ ] **A [[Girocard]] or cash**  
    You must pay the fee of {{ DRIVING_LICENCE_CONVERSION_FEE|cur }}€. Visa and MasterCard are sometimes accepted.[^9]

If your licence is not from a EU or EEA country, you must also bring...

- [ ] **Certified translation of your driving licence**  
    If your driving licence is not in English or German, you need a [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung) or an [International Driving Permit](/glossary/Internationaler%20Führerschein). Get a certified from [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified), [Lingoking](/out/lingoking-drivers-licence) or [ADAC](https://www.adac.de/). It costs around 60€.

If your licence is not from a EU, EEA or [Annex 11](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/fev_2010/anlage_11.html) country, you must also bring...

- [ ] **Eye test certificate**
- [ ] **First aid course certificate**

The appointment only takes a few minutes. It costs {{ DRIVING_LICENCE_CONVERSION_FEE|cur }}€.[^13] The *[[Bürgeramt]]* will send your documents to the *Fahrerlaubnisbehörde*, and they will verify them with your country's embassy.

They will keep your driving licence. If you need to drive, ask for a temporary driving licence (*Vorläufiger Führerschein*). 

### 8. Wait

In Berlin, you must wait **2 to 4 months**.[^10] In other cities, it takes 2 to 6 weeks.[^15] You don't need to do anything; they will send you a letter when your new driving licence is ready.

**[Current processing times in Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/labo/mobilitaet/aktuelles/aktuelle-bearbeitungsstaende-736453.php)** - See when they *start* processing on your application.

### 9. Pick up your German driving licence

After a few weeks, you get a letter. It tells you to pick up your new driver licence at the *Fahrerlaubnisbehörde*. Get an appointment, go to your appointment, wait your turn, show them your passport, and get your new driving licence.
