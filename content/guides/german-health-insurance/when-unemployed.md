## Free health insurance

**If you get [[ALG I]] or [[Bürgergeld]]**, you get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). The state pays for it.[^11] If you had private health insurance, you must usually switch to public health insurance.[^41]

## Public health insurance

**If you don't get ALG I or Bürgergeld**, you can choose public or private health insurance. You can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, if you have public health insurance, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month.[^40] The cost of private health insurance is not related to your income, so it stays the same.

When you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you sometimes get [one month of free health insurance](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance). Your current health insurance pays for it.
