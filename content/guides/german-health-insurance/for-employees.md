This guide helps you choose the best health insurance to work in Germany. All German residents need health insurance. You need it to apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]].

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Your options

Your options depend on your income. Your health insurance is not tied to your job. Your employer does not decide which health insurance you can have. If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance.

Use my [health insurance picker](/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see your options.

### Public health insurance

If your earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can only get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).

You must choose an [insurer](/glossary/Krankenkasse). There are dozens of insurers, but their price and coverage are almost the same. [Barmer](/out/barmer) and [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) are English-speaking options.

### Private health insurance

If your earn more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can choose [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). It's sometimes better and cheaper than public health insurance.[^5]

Don't choose private health insurance yourself. There are too many options. [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. It's a free service.

## For a visa or residence permit

### For a Blue Card or work visa

To apply for a [[Blue Card]] or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa), you have a few options:

- **If you already live in Germany**  
    You can keep your current public or private health insurance.
- **If you move from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**  
    Your [health insurance from your home country](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries) usually covers you until you start working.[^11] It might be cheaper than German health insurance. When you start working, you need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance.
- **If you move from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**  
    You might need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) for your [[National Visa]] application.[^6] It covers you until you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working). When you start working, your public or private health insurance covers you.

[Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to find the right combination of health insurances. It's the easiest way to choose. This is a free service.

### For an opportunity card

To apply for a [[Chancenkarte]], you have 3 options:[^14]

- **[[Expat health insurance]]**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    If you don't have a job offer, it's impossible to get public or private health insurance. Get expat health insurance for your visa application, and switch to public or private when you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).[^10]
- **Travel health insurance + [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    If you have a job, you can already get public health insurance.[^13] Travel insurance covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).[^15] After you start working, your public health insurance covers you. After you start working, your public health insurance covers you.
- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    If you have a job offer, and you earn more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can get private health insurance. Private can be better or cheaper than public.

**[Feather](/out/feather-expats)** sells valid public and expat health insurance. I work with them since 2018. You can also [ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to find the best insurance for you. It's the safest way to choose.

Some [blocked accounts](/glossary/Sperrkonto) include health insurance. It's rarely the best option. Choose health insurance separately.

**[List of expat insurance options ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-a-visa-application#expat-health-insurance-options)**

### For a job seeker visa

**If you are moving to Germany**, you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) for your visa application. When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance.

**If you already live in Germany**, you can keep your current health insurance. When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). If you earn more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) instead.

### For a Working Holiday Visa

To apply for a [[Working Holiday Visa]], you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It must cover you for the entire time you are in Germany.[^7]

**When you start working**, you must switch to public health insurance.[^8] If you make more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can choose [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) instead. If you have a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob), you can stay on expat health insurance.[^9]

### For a Youth Mobility Visa

See the [requirements for a Working Holiday Visa ➞](#for-a-working-holiday-visa)

## For a minijob

If you have a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob), you can choose [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). Public is usually the best option.[^12] You can get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. Your employer does not help you pay for health insurance.[^2]

## For an internship

See **[health insurance for an internship ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students#for-an-internship)**

## If you lose your job

If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance. The coverage does not change.

If you have public health insurance, the price can change. You might get free health insurance. Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month.

**[Health insurance when unemployed ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/when-unemployed)**

## How to get insured

[Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. It's the safest option.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestionStatic.html' %}

Your employer can help you get health insurance. This is a bad idea. They choose what is easy for them, not what is best for you.[^4]
