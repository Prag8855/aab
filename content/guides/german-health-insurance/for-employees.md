### Private health insurance

If your earn more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can choose private health insurance. It's sometimes better and cheaper than public health insurance.

## How to get insured

You must choose insurance yourself.

[Ask my health insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. It's the safest option.

Your employer can help you get health insurance. This is a bad idea. They choose what is easy for them, not what is best for you.[^4]

If you choose public health insurance, there are dozens of options, but their price and coverage are almost the same. [Barmer](/out/barmer) and [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) are expat-friendly options. They speak English.
