## Your options

**Your options depend on your income.** When you are an employee, your health insurance is not tied to your job. If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance. Your employer does not decide which health insurance you can have.

### Public health insurance

If your earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, it's your only option.

You must choose an [insurer](/glossary/Krankenkasse). There are dozens of insurers, but their price and coverage are almost the same. [Barmer](/out/barmer) and [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) are expat-friendly options. They speak English.

If you need a visa to enter Germany, you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) for your visa application.[^1] It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you start working. When you start working, your public health insurance covers you.

### Private health insurance

If your earn more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can choose private health insurance. It's sometimes better and cheaper than public health insurance.

## How to get insured

You must choose insurance yourself.

[Ask my health insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. It's the safest option.

Your employer can help you get health insurance. This is a bad idea. They choose what is easy for them, not what is best for you.[^4]

If you choose public health insurance, there are dozens of options, but their price and coverage are almost the same. [Barmer](/out/barmer) and [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) are expat-friendly options. They speak English.
