If you [work in Germany](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), you must have health insurance. This guide helps you choose the best health insurance for employees.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Your options

Employees must get [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). Use my [health insurance picker](/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to find the best option.

{% with occupation = 'employee' %}{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculatorStatic.html' %}{% endwith %}

Your options depend on your income:

- **If your earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year**  
    You can only choose [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). It costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}} per month.
- **If your earn more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year**  
    You can choose [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). Private can be better and cheaper.[^5] Don't choose private health insurance yourself. [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you.

**[What is the best option? ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance#what-is-the-best-option)**

**If you apply for a [[National Visa]]**, you also need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working). I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). When you start working, you must switch to public or private health insurance.

**[Get health insurance ➞](#how-to-get-insured)**

## For a visa or residence permit

You must get health insurance *before* you apply for a [[National Visa]] or a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). Your application must include a proof of health insurance.

### For a Blue Card or a work visa

To apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], you need two health insurances:[^6]

- [ ] **Incoming health insurance**  
    Get [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you start working. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). If you already live in Germany, you don't need incoming health insurance.
- [ ] **Long-term health insurance**  
    Get [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). For public health insurance, I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). For private health insurance, I recommend [asking an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers).

### For an opportunity card

To apply for a *[[Chancenkarte]]*, you only need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^10] It must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). If you already live in Germany, you can keep your current health insurance.

When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance.

If you already live in Germany, you can keep your current health insurance.

When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance.

### For a Working Holiday Visa

To apply for a [[Working Holiday Visa]], you only need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^7] It must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance).

When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance.

### For a Youth Mobility Visa

To apply for a [[Youth Mobility Visa]], you only need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^7] It must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance).

When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. If you have a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob), you can stay on expat health insurance.[^9]

**[Get health insurance for your Youth Mobility Visa ➞](#how-to-get-insured)**

## For an internship

If it's a **mandatory internship during your studies**, you keep your [student health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students). Your employer does not pay half of it.[^12]

If it's a **mandatory internship before or after your studies**:[^1]

- **If it's unpaid**  
    You have [the same options as other students](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students).[^2]
- **It it pays up to €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    Your health insurance is free. Your employer pays for it.[^11] You must still choose an insurer. I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk).
- **If it pays more than €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    You have [the same options as other employees](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees).

If it's a **voluntary internship**, it's treated like a normal job. You have the [same options as an employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees).[^3] If you don't get paid, you have the [same options as an unemployed student](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students), and you don't get help from your employer.[^8]

## If you lose your job

If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance. The coverage does not change. You can sometimes get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

**If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**, it becomes cheaper, because the cost is proportional to your income. Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month.

**If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**, your employer stops paying half of it, so it's twice as expensive for you. For example, if you paid €250 per month as an employee, you must now pay €500 per month. If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), you must usually switch to public health insurance, then your unemployment benefits pay for it. Otherwise, you can't switch to public health insurance.

## How to get insured

- **For [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). They are reliable, English-speaking health insurers.
- **For [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Always [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). Never choose private health insurance yourself. You can make expensive mistakes, and it's really hard to fix them.
- **For [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-health), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). Feather is a reliable, English-speaking insurer in Berlin. We work together since 2018. Their expat health insurance works for a [[National Visa]] application.
- **If you are not sure**  
    [Read my health insurance guide](/guides/german-health-insurance), and [ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. Their help is free.

Your employer can choose health insurance for you, but it's a bad idea. They choose what is easy for them, not what is best for you.[^4]

**After you get insured**, you get a [proof of health insurance](/glossary/Mitgliedsbescheinigung) for your visa application. You must tell your employer which health insurance you have. You must pay for health insurance every month. The payments are taken directly from your paycheck.
