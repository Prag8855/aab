## Your options

Your options depend on your income. When you are an employee, your health insurance is not tied to your job. If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance. Your employer does not decide which health insurance you can have.

### Public health insurance

If your earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, it's your only option.

You must choose an [insurer](/glossary/Krankenkasse). There are dozens of insurers, but their price and coverage are almost the same. [Barmer](/out/barmer) and [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) are expat-friendly options. They speak English.

If you need a visa to enter Germany, you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) for your visa application.[^1] It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you start working. When you start working, your public health insurance covers you.

### Private health insurance

If your earn more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can choose private health insurance. It's sometimes better and cheaper than public health insurance.

Never choose private health insurance yourself; always [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers).

## For a minijob

**If you have a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob)**, you can choose [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). Public is usually the best option.[^56] You can get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. Your employer does not help you pay for health insurance.[^36]

## If you lose your job

If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you can get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month.

## For a Blue Card or work visa

**If you move from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, your [health insurance from your home country](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries) usually covers you until you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).[^47] It might be cheaper than German health insurance.

**If you move from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, you might need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It covers you until you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working). When you start working, you must switch to public or private health insurance. A [health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) can arrange this for you.

If you choose public health insurance, you might need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) for your [[National Visa]] application.[^10] It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working). After you start working, your public health insurance covers you.
