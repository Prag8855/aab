This guide explains which health insurance you need for a visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## For a Schengen visa

To apply for a [[Schengen visa]] (tourist visa), you need **travel health insurance**.[^0]

Your travel health insurance must...[^1]

- [ ] Cover you for at least €30,000
- [ ] Be valid in *all* [[Schengen area]] countries, not just Germany
- [ ] Be valid during your whole trip in the Schengen area

**[HanseMerkur Visa Plus](/out/hansemerkur-travel)** works well for a Schengen visa application.

[If you can visit Germany without a visa](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/-/231148), you don't need travel insurance, but it's still a good idea.

## For a National Visa

**To apply for a [[National Visa]]** at the German embassy or consulate, you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). This temporary insurance covers you during your first few months in Germany. [Feather's expat insurance](/out/feather-expats) works well for a National Visa.

The requirements depend on the visa you apply for:

- [Health insurance for a **Blue Card**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-blue-card-or-work-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **work visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-blue-card-or-work-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **student visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students#insurance-for-a-student-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **freelance visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers#insurance-for-a-freelance-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **Working Holiday Visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-working-holiday-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **Youth Mobility Visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-youth-mobility-visa)
- [Health insurance for an **opportunity card**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-an-opportunity-card)
- [Health insurance for a **job seeker visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-job-seeker-visa)

If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you do not need a National Visa. You can come to Germany without a visa, and apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. You do not need health insurance to come to Germany, but you need health insurance [to apply for your residence permit](#for-a-residence-permit).

**When you arrive in Germany**, you must usually switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. You must switch before you convert your National Visa to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). The best option depends on your situation.

Use my [health insurance picker](/tools/health-insurance-calculator), or [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

## For a residence permit

When you arrive in Germany, you must convert your [[National Visa]] to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

To apply for a residence permit, you need...

- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    It's always accepted. If you are unemployed, you can use [your family's health insurance](/glossary/Familienversicherung) for free.
- or **[private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Full private health insurance is always accepted. It must fulfil the requirements of § 257 SGB V.
- or **[expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    [Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) is *sometimes* accepted when you apply for your first residence permit. It depends on which residence permit you apply for. Expat health insurance is rarely accepted when you change or renew your residence permit.

**[What is the best option? ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance#what-is-the-best-option)**

The exact requirements depend on your occupation:

- [Health insurance for a **student**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students)
- [Health insurance for a **freelancer**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)

**[How to apply for permanent residence ➞](/guides/permanent-residence)**

## For citizenship

To apply for German citizenship, you need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. [[Expat health insurance]] and travel insurance are not accepted.

### Expat health insurance options

Insurance from these companies usually works for a [[National Visa]] application:

- **[Feather](/out/feather-expats)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    It works really well.[^12] It's a German company. They speak English, and they have excellent customer service. I work with them since 2018, and I trust them the most.
- **[Care Concept](/out/care-concept)**  
    It's usually accepted.[^5] It's not the best insurance, but it works.
- **[Mawista](/out/mawista-expats)**  
    It's usually accepted, but it's a bad insurance.[^11]
- **[Dr Walter Educare24](/out/dr-walter)**  
    Usually accepted for an opportunity card.
- **[April International](/out/april)**[^7]
- **[Allianz Worldwide Care](https://www.allianzcare.com/en.html)**[^13]
- **[Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats)**  
    It works well too.[^4] They sell their own private and expat health insurance. They speak English. They are [not the best long-term option](/guides/ottonova-review).

Some [blocked accounts](/glossary/Sperrkonto) include health insurance. It's rarely the best option. Choose health insurance separately.
