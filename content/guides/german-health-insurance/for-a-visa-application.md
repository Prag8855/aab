## For a Schengen visa

To apply for a [[Schengen visa]] (tourist visa), you need **travel health insurance**.[^0] [If you can visit Germany without a visa](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/-/231148), you don't need travel insurance, but it's still a good idea.

Your travel health insurance must...[^1]

- [ ] Cover you for at least €30,000
- [ ] Cover you in *all* [[Schengen area]] countries, not just Germany
- [ ] Cover you during your whole trip in the Schengen area

**[HanseMerkur Visa Plus](/out/hansemerkur-travel)** works well for a Schengen visa application.

## For a National Visa

To apply for a [[National Visa]], you need two health insurances:

- **Incoming health insurance**  
    This is [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany until you start working or studying. There are [many valid options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats) or [HanseMerkur](/out/hansemerkur-expats).
- and **long-term health insurance**  
    When you start working or studying, you must usually switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. For public health insurance, choose [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). For private health insurance, always [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). If you get long-term health insurance from [Feather](/out/feather-health), you get free incoming health insurance.

**[How to choose health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

In the [[Consular Services Portal]], you must upload a proof of incoming health insurance *and* a proof of long-term health insurance. [Merge them together](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html), and upload them under *Proof of health insurance*.

Your incoming health insurance must cover you from the day you plan to arrive in Germany. It must match the dates you entered in the *Travel data* form in the [[Consular Services Portal]].

### For a family reunion visa

If your spouse has [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), it might [cover you for free](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).[^2] Otherwise, you can get [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).

## For a residence permit

When you arrive in Germany, you must convert your [[National Visa]] to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

To apply for a residence permit, you need...

- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    It's always accepted. If you are unemployed, you can use [your family's health insurance](/glossary/Familienversicherung) for free.
- or **[private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Full private health insurance is always accepted. It must fulfil the requirements of § 257 SGB V.
- or **[expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    [Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) is *sometimes* accepted when you apply for your first residence permit. It depends on which residence permit you apply for. Expat health insurance is rarely accepted when you change or renew your residence permit.

**[What is the best option? ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance#what-is-the-best-option)**

The exact requirements depend on your occupation:

- [Health insurance for an **employee**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-visa-or-residence-permit)
- [Health insurance for a **student**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students)
- [Health insurance for a **freelancer**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)
- [Health insurance for an **apprentice**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-apprentices)

## For permanent residence

To apply for permanent residence, you need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. [[Expat health insurance]] and travel insurance are not accepted.

**[How to apply for permanent residence ➞](/guides/permanent-residence)**

## For citizenship

To apply for German citizenship, you need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. [[Expat health insurance]] and travel insurance are not accepted.

## How to choose

Do not choose health insurance yourself. You can make expensive mistakes. Choosing the wrong insurance can delay your visa application.

[Ask my health insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. His help is free. It's the best way to choose health insurance.
