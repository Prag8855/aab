## Your options

If you are self-employed, you can choose public, private or expat health insurance. Use my [health insurance picker](/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see your options.

When you have a job, your employer pays half of your health insurance. If you are self-employed, you pay the full price yourself. If your health insurance cost €250 as an employee, it will cost €500 as a freelancer.

**If you just moved from a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, you have 2 options:

- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    If you had public health insurance in your previous country, you can get public health insurance in Germany.[^9] You have 3 months to choose public health insurance.[^10] This is the safest option. If you have a low income, it's the cheapest option.[^12] You can switch to private later if it makes more sense.[^5]
- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    If you earn more than €60,000 per year, private can be better and cheaper than public health insurance.[^8] If you had private health insurance in your previous country, it might be your only option.

**If you just moved from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, you have 3 options:

- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    If your income is over €60,000 per year, this is the best long-term solution.
- **[[Expat health insurance]]**  
    If your income is below €30,000 per year, it might be your only option.[^2] It's the cheapest health insurance, but it's a temporary solution and the coverage is not great. Switch to private as soon as you can.[^6]

**If you already live in Germany**, you have 2 options:

- **Keep your [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    If you have a low or unstable income, this is the safest option, because the price matches your income. You can switch to private later if it makes more sense.[^5]
- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    If you earn more than €60,000 per year, private can be better and cheaper than public health insurance.[^8] It might be your only option.

You can also get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) [through your family](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance), or by [joining the *Künstlersozialkasse*](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse). Otherwise, public health insurers will reject you.[^11]

### The Künstlersozialkasse

If you are an artist, journalist, publicist or art teacher, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It's always worth it.

If you earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) after you join the KSK. It's a good way to switch from private to public.

Joining the KSK takes a few months. While you wait, you can get public, private or expat health insurance.

## Insurance for a freelance visa

You need health insurance to [apply for a freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa). Applications are often rejected because of invalid health insurance.[^4]

**[How to apply for a freelance visa ➞](/guides/freelance-visa)**

If you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), you usually need public or private health insurance. Expat health insurance is rarely accepted.

If you renew a freelance visa, you usually need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. Expat health insurance is rarely accepted.[^1]

## How to choose

If you are self-employed, **never choose health insurance yourself**. It's a complicated decision, and you can make big mistakes. The cheapest option today can be an expensive mistake later. The best option depends on your citizenship, your income, your health, and your plans for the future.
