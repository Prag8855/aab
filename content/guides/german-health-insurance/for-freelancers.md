## Your options

If you are self-employed, you can choose public, private or expat health insurance. The best option depends on many factors. The best way to choose is to [ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers).

### Public health insurance

[Public health insurance](#public-health-insurance) costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The minimum cost is around [€{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) per month. The maximum cost is around [€{{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) per month.

**If you just moved from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, it's almost impossible to get public health insurance. Usually, you must get private or expat health insurance.[^71]

**If you just moved from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, ???

If you are a self-employed student, you can't get the student tariff.

You can't get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance)

You can't use [health insurance from another EU country](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries).[^37]

If you just moved to Germany, public health insurers might reject you. Private health insurance might be your only option.

### Private health insurance

[Private health insurance](#private-health-insurance) is usually cheaper. The cost is based on your age and your health when you sign up, and the level of coverage you choose.[^79] Don't choose private health insurance if you have an unstable income, or you earn less than €30,000 per year.[^27] Insurers often reject people with a low or unstable income.[^55] Ideally, you should make more than €60,000 per year.[^69]

If you have a high income and a stable business, private might be a better option. It can be better and cheaper than public health insurance. You should earn more than €30,000 per year, ideally more than €60,000 per year.

If your income is below €30,000 per year, it's really hard to get private health insurance. You might need additional proofs of income to prove that you can pay for your insurance every month.

If you have pre-existing health problems, your insurance might be really expensive.

### Expat health insurance

[Expat health insurance](#expat-health-insurance) is the cheapest option. This is supposed to be temporary health insurance. You can use it to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa). Staying on expat insurance is a really bad idea. Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you can.

If you have a low income, it might be your only option.

### Künstlersozialkasse

If you are a freelance artist, journalist, publicist or influencer, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It's always worth it. If you earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you must switch to public health insurance.
