### Public health insurance

[Public health insurance](#public-health-insurance) costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. If you make less than €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month, you can get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

Choose public health insurance if...

- **You have a low or unstable income**  
    If you earn under €30,000 per year, public health insurance is a safer, cheaper option.[^27] If you can get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance), it's the best option.
- **You have more than 2 children**  
    Your public health insurance [covers your children and unemployed spouse for free](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). If you have many children, public is usually the best option.
- **You have pre-existing health problems**  
    Your health does not affect the cost.
- **You are over 45 years old**  
    Your age does not affect the cost. After 45 years old, public is usually a better deal than private.
- **You are a student under 30 years old**  
    If you make less than €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month, you pay the student tariff: around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month. This is a really good deal.

You can't choose public health insurance if...

- **You just moved from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**  
    It's almost impossible to get public health insurance. Usually, you must get [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) or [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^71]
- **You currently have private health insurance**  
    It's really hard to switch to public health insurance. You can switch by joining the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]*.

### Private health insurance

The cost of [private health insurance](#private-health-insurance) is based on your age and your health when you sign up, and the level of coverage you choose.[^79] Private health insurance lets you choose better coverage or a lower price. It can be better *and* cheaper than public health insurance.

Choose private health insurance if...

- **You have a high, stable income**  
    If you have a high income and a stable business, private might be a better option. Ideally, you should earn more than €60,000 per year.[^69]
- **You are young and healthy**  
    ???If you have pre-existing health problems, your insurance might be really expensive.

You can't choose private health insurance if...

- **Your earn less than €30,000 per year**  
    Private health insurers usually reject freelancers with a low or unstable income.[^55] You might need more proofs of income to show that you can pay for your insurance every month.

### Expat health insurance

[Expat health insurance](#expat-health-insurance) is the cheapest option. This is supposed to be temporary health insurance. You can use it to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa). Staying on expat insurance is a really bad idea. Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you can.

If you have a low income, it might be your only option.

### Künstlersozialkasse

If you are a freelance artist, journalist, publicist or influencer, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It's always worth it.

If you earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Joining the KSK is a good way to switch from private to public health insurance.
