{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculatorStatic.html' %}

### Under 30 years old

If you are under 30 years old, you have 3 options:

- **[Free health insurance](/glossary/Familienversicherung)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    Your spouse's public health insurance can [cover you for free](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). If you are under 25 years old, your parents' insurance can also cover you.
- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    If you can't get free health insurance, public is usually the best option.[^59] You pay the student tariff: around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month. If you move from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union), you might also need travel health insurance between the day you arrive and the day you start studying.
- **[Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    If you are under 30 years old, it's rarely worth it.[^88] It can be cheaper, but the coverage is much worse. Public health insurance is a better option. If you choose expat health insurance, you are stuck with it until you graduate.[^3]

**If you work less than 20 hours per week**, you keep the cheaper student tariff. Your employer does not pay half of your health insurance.[^7]

**If you work more than 20 hours per week**, you are treated [like a normal employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees).[^46] You must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It costs a percentage of your income. Your employer pays half of your health insurance. You can't get the student tariff, and you can't get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

### Over 30 years old

If you are over 30 years old, your options change.

**If you just moved from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, you can't get public health insurance.[^2] [[Expat health insurance]] might be your only option.[^91] It costs around €{{OTTONOVA_STUDENT_COST|cur}} per month. [Feather](/out/feather-students) and [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-students) sell expat health insurance. You can also [ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

**If you just moved from another EU country**, you have more options:

- **[Insurance from your home country](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    Your [[EHIC]] covers you until you graduate or [get a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). You might not need German health insurance.[^39]
- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    It costs around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month, because you don't get the student tariff.[^25] If you work, you are treated [like a normal employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees); public health insurance costs a percentage of your income.
- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Usually, you can't get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) because your income is too low.[^90] Some insurers offer private health insurance for EU students, and it can be cheaper.[^87] If you choose private health insurance, you are stuck with it until you graduate.[^3] [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if it makes sense for your situation.

**If you already live in Germany**, you can choose [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. The best option depends on your situation. [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

### Self-employment

If you are self-employed during your studies, you can keep your student health insurance. The price does not change; you still pay the student tariff.[^8]

**If you work more than 20 hours per week**, you are treated [like other self-employed people](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers), and your public health insurance costs a percentage of your income. If you are young and healthy, [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) or [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) usually make more sense.[^5]

**If your income is over €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}** per month, you can't get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

## Insurance for a student visa

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you have 2 options:

- **Travel insurance + [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    The travel insurance covers you before school starts.[^6] Public health insurance covers you until you graduate. If you are under 30 years old, this is the best option. You get great coverage for a low price. [Barmer](/out/barmer) and [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) are English-speaking options.
- **[Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    If you are over 30 years old, public health insurance is more expensive. Expat health insurance is cheaper, but the coverage is worse. It covers you until you graduate. [Feather](/out/feather-students) and [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-students) sell expat health insurance. You can also [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. It's a free service.

**[Feather](/out/feather-students)** sells valid insurance for a student visa. They offer both options, so you will get the best option for your situation. I work with them since 2018; you can trust them.

## For an internship

If it's a **mandatory internship during your studies**, you keep your student insurance. Your employer does not pay half of it.[^50]

If it's a **mandatory internship before or after your studies**:[^65]

- **If it's unpaid**  
    You have [the same options as other students](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students).[^64]
- **It it pays up to €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    Your health insurance is free. Your employer pays for it.[^49]
- **If it pays more than €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    You have [the same options as other employees](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees).

If it's a **voluntary internship**, it's treated like a normal job. You have the [same options as an employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees).[^67] If you don't get paid, you have the [same options as an unemployed student](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students), and you don't get help from your employer.[^68]

## For an apprenticeship

**[Health insurance for Azubis ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-apprentices)**

## After you graduate

If you start working, you must usually get public health insurance. [Finding a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) is the best way to switch to public health insurance.

If you make more than €{{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can also get private health insurance.

**[Health insurance for employees ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees)**

If you are unemployed or self-employed, you might be stuck with your current private health insurance until you find a job.[^4]

## How to get insured

For students, [Feather](/out/feather-students) is one of the easiest way to get insured. They sell public and expat health insurance. They speak English, they have excellent customer service, and they have a lot of experience with foreign students.

If you want personalised advice, [ask my health insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). He will help you find the cheapest health insurance. He also gives you a proof of insurance for your visa application. This is a free service.

After you get insured, your insurer tells your university (the *M10 Meldung*). This is done digitally; you don't need to do anything. It takes around 3 days.[^1] You also get a *[[Mitgliedsbescheinigung]]* for your student visa application.
