## Your options

### Free health insurance

**[Free health insurance options ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance)**

### Public health insurance

If you are over 30 years old, public health insurance costs at least ??? per month. If you are a foreign student, expat health insurance might be cheaper.

**If you are under 30 years old**, [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) is usually the best option.[^59] You pay the student tariff: around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month.[^89]

**If you are under 25 years old**, your spouse or parents' [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) can cover you for free. Otherwise, you pay the student tariff: around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month.

**If you are under 30 years old**, you pay the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) is usually the best option.[^59] It costs around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month.

If you just moved from a non-EU country, and you are over 30 years old, you can't get public health insurance.

### Expat health insurance

Foreign students can get [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). If you are under 30 years old, it's rarely worth it.[^88]

If you decide to not choose public, you are stuck with your decision until the end of your studies.

You also need to talk to a public health insurance that will do the M10 Meldung for you.

Foreign students can get [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). If you are under 30 years old, it's rarely worth it.[^88]

### EHIC

**If you are a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) student**, you can also use [health insurance from your home country](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries).[^39] You might not need German health insurance.

### Private health insurance

Usually, you can't get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) because your income is too low.[^90] It's rarely the best option anyway.

## Health insurance for a student visa

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you have 2 options:

- **Travel insurance + [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    The travel insurance covers you before school starts. Public health insurance covers you until you graduate. If you are under 30 years old, this is the best option. You get great coverage for a low price. [Barmer](/out/barmer) and [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) are expat-friendly options.
- **[Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    If you are over 30 years old, public health insurance is more expensive. Expat health insurance is cheaper, but the coverage is limited. It covers you until you graduate. [Feather](/out/feather-students) and [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-students) sell expat health insurance. You can also [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. It's a free service.

**[Feather](/out/feather-students)** sells valid insurance for a student visa. They offer both options, so you will get the best option for your situation. I work with them since 2018; you can trust them. 

After you get insured, your insurer tells your university (the *M10 Meldung*). This is done digitally; you don't need to do anything. It takes around 3 days.[^15] You also get a *[[Mitgliedsbescheinigung]]* for your student visa application.

After you arrive in Germany, your insurer needs your German address and your [[IBAN]].[^16]

## For an internship

If it's a **mandatory internship during your studies**, you keep your student insurance. Your employer does not pay half of it.[^50]

If it's a **mandatory internship before or after your studies**:[^65]

- **If it's unpaid**  
    You have [the same options as other students](#health-insurance-for-students).[^64]
- **It it pays up to €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    Your health insurance is free. Your employer pays for it.[^49]
- **If it pays more than €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    You have [the same options as other employees](#health-insurance-for-employees).

If it's a **voluntary internship**, it's treated like a normal job. You have the [same options as an employee](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^67] If you don't get paid, you have the [same options as an unemployed student](#health-insurance-for-students), and you don't get help from your employer.[^68]

## For an apprenticeship

## After you graduate

- Usually, your job forces you onto the public system
    - Not applicable to unemployed or self-employed people, among others





**If you are over 30 years old**, you can't get the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around [€{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag).[^25] [Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) might be cheaper for you; they usually have a cheaper tariff for students.[^87] You can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). If you work, you are treated [like a normal employee](#health-insurance-for-employees); public health insurance costs a percentage of your income.

**If you are a non-EU student**, you can get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). If you are under 30 years old, [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) is usually the best option. If you are over 30 years old [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) might make more sense.[^91] [Feather](/out/feather-students) is one of the easiest way to get insured.

**If you are self-employed**, and your income is over €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month, you are treated [like a self-employed person](#health-insurance-for-freelancers). You can't get the student tariff and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). If you are young and healthy, [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) usually makes the most sense.[^58]

**If you work over 20 hours per week**, you are treated [like a normal employee](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^46] You can't get the student tariff, and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). There are different rules for [internships](#health-insurance-for-an-internship) and [apprenticeships](#health-insurance-for-an-apprenticeship).

[Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. They help you find the cheapest health insurance. They also give you a proof of insurance for your school and your visa application. This is a free service.
