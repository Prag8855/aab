This guide helps you choose the best student health insurance. You need health insurance to apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), and to study at a German university.

Use my [health insurance picker](/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see your options.

## Health insurance for a student visa

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you need two health insurances:[^10]

- [ ] **Incoming health insurance**  
    Get [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you start university.[^6] It's cheap, but the coverage is limited. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). If you already live in Germany, you don't need incoming health insurance.
- [ ] **Long-term health insurance**  
    Get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It covers you after you start university. I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). You can stay on expat health insurance until you graduate, but public health insurance is much better.

**[Get health insurance for your visa ➞](#how-to-get-insured)**

After you [get insured](#how-to-get-insured), you get two documents: a proof of incoming health insurance and a [proof of long-term health insurance](/glossary/Mitgliedsbescheinigung). [Merge them together](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html), and upload them on the [Consulate Service Portal](/glossary/Consular%20Services%20Portal).[^12]

![Proof of health insurance in the Consular Services Portal](/images/csp-proof-of-health-insurance.png "Upload your health insurance certificates here")

Your incoming health insurance must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. It must match the arrival date in the [[Consular Services Portal]].

![Planned date of entry in the Consular Services Portal](/images/csp-length-of-stay.png "Your health insurance must cover you from this date.")

Your public health insurer will tell your university that you are insured (the *M10 Meldung*). This is done digitally; you don't need to do anything. It takes around 3 days.[^1]

## For students under 30 years old

If you are under 30 years old, there are 3 long-term health insurance options:

- **Free health insurance**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    - **[Family health insurance](/glossary/Familienversicherung)**  
        If your spouse has public health insurance, it [covers you for free](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). If you are under 25 years old, your parents' insurance can also cover you for free.
    - **[Insurance from your home country](/glossary/EHIC)**  
        Your [[EHIC]] covers you until you graduate or [get a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). You might not need German health insurance.[^39]
- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    If you can't get free health insurance, this is the best option.[^59] It costs around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month. I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). Switch to public health insurance *maximum* 3 months after you start university.[^9]
- **[Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    You can stay on expat health insurance until the end of your studies. It costs around €{{EXPAT_STUDENT_COST|cur}} per month. This is the cheapest option, but the coverage is much worse. If you stay on expat health insurance, you are stuck with it until you graduate.[^3]

## For students over 30 years old

After 30 years old, your options change.

- **Free health insurance**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    - **[Family health insurance](/glossary/Familienversicherung)**  
        If your spouse has public health insurance, it [covers you for free](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). Your parents' health insurance can't cover you, because you are too old.
    - **[Insurance from your home country](/glossary/EHIC)**  
        Your [[EHIC]] covers you until you graduate or [get a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). You might not need German health insurance.[^39]
- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    It costs around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. It's more expensive because you can't get the student tariff.[^25]
- **[Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    This is the cheapest option, but the coverage is much worse. [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if it makes sense for you.
- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Usually, you can't get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) because your income is too low,[^90] but some insurers have cheap tariffs for students.[^87] If you choose private health insurance, you are stuck with it until you graduate.[^3] [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if it makes sense for you.

**If you just moved to Germany**, you probably can't get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). [[Expat health insurance]] might be your only option.[^13] You can get public health insurance if you had public health insurance in another EU country for 2 of the last 5 years.[^2]

**If you already live in Germany**, you can keep your current [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). If you currently have private or expat health insurance, it's really hard to switch to public health insurance.

If you are over 30 years old, don't choose health insurance yourself. [Ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. It's a free service.

## For working students

### Student jobs

**If you work less than 20 hours per week**, nothing changes.[^46] You pay the same price for public health insurance. You can still get [free health insurance](/glossary/Familienversicherung). You can also keep your [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). Your employer does not pay half of your health insurance.[^7]

**If you work more than 20 hours per week**, you must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) and pay the [the same price as other employees](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees). You can't get the student tariff, and you can't get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

Your student visa might not allow working more than 20 hours per week.[^14]

### Internships and apprenticeships

**[Health insurance for an internship ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-an-internship)**

**[Health insurance for Azubis ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-apprentices)**

### Self-employment

If you are self-employed during your studies, you can keep your student health insurance. The price does not change; you still pay the student tariff.[^8]

**If you work more than 20 hours per week**, you are treated [like other self-employed people](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers), and your public health insurance costs a percentage of your income. If you are young and healthy, [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) or [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) usually make more sense.[^5]

**If your earn more than €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month**, you can't get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

## For a language course visa

To apply for a language course visa, you only need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance).

You don't need long-term health insurance.[^11] Usually, you can't get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).

**[Get health insurance ➞](#how-to-get-insured)**

## For a study preparation visa

To apply for a study preparation visa, you only need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance).

You don't need long-term health insurance.[^11] You can switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) when you start university.

**[Get health insurance ➞](#how-to-get-insured)**

## After you graduate

When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must usually get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). If you make more than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can also choose [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).

**[Health insurance for employees ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees)**

If you are unemployed or self-employed, you might be stuck with your current private or expat health insurance until you find a job.[^4]

**[Health insurance when unemployed ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/when-unemployed)**

**[Health insurance for freelancers ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)**

## How to get insured

There are many ways to get insured:

- **[Feather](/out/feather-students)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    They sell incoming and long-term health insurance. I work with them since 2018. They have great customer service, and their insurance is valid for a visa application.
- **[Ask our expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers)**  
    This is the best option if you are over 30 years old, if you have a special situation, or if you have questions.
- [Expatrio](/out/expatrio), [Fintiba](/out/fintiba) and [Coracle](/out/coracle) sell packages that include a [blocked account](/glossary/Sperrkonto), incoming health insurance and long-term health insurance.

You can also buy health insurance directly from the insurer. The prices are the same. For [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance), use [this list of options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). For [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). They are the biggest insurers in Germany.
