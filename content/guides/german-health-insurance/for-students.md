This guide helps you choose the best student health insurance. You need health insurance to apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), and to study at a German university.

Use my [health insurance picker](/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see your options.

## Health insurance for a student visa

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you need two health insurances:[^10]

- [ ] **Incoming health insurance**  
    Get [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you start university.[^6] It's cheap, but the coverage is limited. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). If you already live in Germany, you don't need incoming health insurance.
- [ ] **Long-term health insurance**  
    Get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It covers you after you start university. I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). You can stay on expat health insurance until you graduate, but public health insurance is much better.

**[Get health insurance for your visa ➞](#how-to-get-insured)**

After you [get insured](#how-to-get-insured), you get two documents: a proof of incoming health insurance and a [proof of long-term health insurance](/glossary/Mitgliedsbescheinigung). [Merge them together](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html), and upload them on the [Consulate Service Portal](/glossary/Consular%20Services%20Portal).[^12]

![Proof of health insurance in the Consular Services Portal](/images/csp-proof-of-health-insurance.png "Upload your health insurance certificates here")

Your incoming health insurance must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. It must match the arrival date in the [[Consular Services Portal]].

![Planned date of entry in the Consular Services Portal](/images/csp-length-of-stay.png "Your health insurance must cover you from this date.")

Your public health insurer will tell your university that you are insured (the *M10 Meldung*). This is done digitally; you don't need to do anything. It takes around 3 days.[^1]

## For students under 30 years old

If you are under 30 years old, there are 3 long-term health insurance options:

- **Free health insurance**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    - **[Family health insurance](/glossary/Familienversicherung)**  
        If your spouse has public health insurance, it [covers you for free](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance). If you are under 25 years old, your parents' insurance can also cover you for free.
    - **[Insurance from your home country](/glossary/EHIC)**  
        Your [[EHIC]] covers you until you graduate or [get a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). You might not need German health insurance.[^39]
- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    If you can't get free health insurance, this is the best option.[^59] It costs around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month. I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). Switch to public health insurance *maximum* 3 months after you start university.[^9]
- **[Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)**  
    You can stay on expat health insurance until the end of your studies. It costs around €{{EXPAT_STUDENT_COST|cur}} per month. This is the cheapest option, but the coverage is much worse. If you stay on expat health insurance, you are stuck with it until you graduate.[^3]

**[What is the best option? ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance#what-is-the-best-option)**

**[Get student health insurance ➞](#how-to-get-insured)**

**If you work less than 20 hours per week**, you keep the cheaper student tariff. Your employer does not pay half of your health insurance.[^7]

**If you work more than 20 hours per week**, you are treated [like a normal employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees).[^46] You must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It costs a percentage of your income. Your employer pays half of your health insurance. You can't get the student tariff, and you can't get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

## For students over 30 years old

If you are over 30 years old, your long-term health insurance options are different.

**If you just moved from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**, you can't get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^2] [[Expat health insurance]] might be your only option.[^91] It costs €{{FEATHER_STUDENT_COST|cur}} to €{{OTTONOVA_STUDENT_COST|cur}} per month. [Feather](/out/feather-students) and [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-students) sell expat health insurance. You can also [ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

**If you just moved from another EU country**, you have more options:

- **[Insurance from your home country](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    Your [[EHIC]] covers you until you graduate or [get a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). You might not need German health insurance.[^39]
- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    It costs around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month, because you don't get the student tariff.[^25] If you work, you are treated [like a normal employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees); public health insurance costs a percentage of your income.
- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Usually, you can't get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) because your income is too low.[^90] Some insurers offer private health insurance for EU students, and it can be cheaper.[^87] If you choose private health insurance, you are stuck with it until you graduate.[^3] [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if it makes sense for your situation.

**If you already live in Germany**, you can choose [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. The best option depends on your situation. [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

### Self-employment

If you are self-employed during your studies, you can keep your student health insurance. The price does not change; you still pay the student tariff.[^8]

**If you work more than 20 hours per week**, you are treated [like other self-employed people](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers), and your public health insurance costs a percentage of your income. If you are young and healthy, [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) or [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) usually make more sense.[^5]

**If your earn more than €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month**, you can't get [free health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance#free-health-insurance).

## For a language course

To apply for a language course visa, you only need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance).

## For study preparation

To apply for a study preparation visa, you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^11] It must cover you from the day you arrive in Germany. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats) or [HanseMerkur](/out/hansemerkur-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance).

When you start university, you can switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).

## For an internship

**[Health insurance for an internship ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-an-internship)**

## For an apprenticeship

**[Health insurance for Azubis ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-apprentices)**

## After you graduate

When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), you must usually get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). If you make more than €{{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per year, you can also get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).

**[Health insurance for employees ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees)**

If you are unemployed or self-employed, you might be stuck with your current private health insurance until you find a job.[^4]

**[Health insurance when unemployed ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/when-unemployed)**

**[Health insurance for freelancers ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)**

## How to get insured

There are many ways to get insured:

- **[Feather](/out/feather-students)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    They sell incoming and long-term health insurance. I work with them since 2018. They have great customer service, and their insurance is valid for a visa application.
- **[Ask our expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers)**  
    This is the best option if you are over 30 years old, if you have a special situation, or if you have questions.
- [Expatrio](/out/expatrio), [Fintiba](/out/fintiba) and [Coracle](/out/coracle) sell packages that include a [blocked account](/glossary/Sperrkonto), incoming health insurance and long-term health insurance.

You can also buy health insurance directly from the insurer. The prices are the same. For [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance), use [this list of options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). For [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), I recommend [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [TK](/out/feather-tk). They are the biggest insurers in Germany.
