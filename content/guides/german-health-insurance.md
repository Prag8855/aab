When you [move to Germany](/guides/moving-to-berlin), you must choose health insurance. This guide explains how it works, and how to choose the best health insurance.

All German residents need health insurance. It pays for your healthcare when you are sick. You also need it to [start a new job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), study at a German university, or [apply for a residence permit](/guides/residence-permit).

- [Health insurance for **students**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students)
- [Health insurance for **freelancers**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)
- [Health insurance for **apprentices**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-apprentices) (*[Azubis](/glossary/Azubi)*)
- [Health insurance when **unemployed**](/guides/german-health-insurance/when-unemployed)

## Public health insurance

Public health insurance is run by [non-profit insurance funds](/glossary/Krankenkasse), not by the state. The cost and coverage are almost the same for all public health insurers.[^85] 87% of Germans have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^2] It's often your only option.

### Cost of public health insurance

Public health insurance costs {{GKV_BASE_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income, plus around {{GKV_AVG_ZUSATZBEITRAG}}% for the [insurer surcharge](/glossary/Zusatzbeitrag), and {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MIN_RATE}}% to {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MAX_RATE}}% for [long-term care insurance](/glossary/Pflegeversicherung). If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it.

- **[If you are an employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees)**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}} per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}} per month. Health insurance payments are taken from your paycheck each month.
- **[If you are a student](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students)**, you usually pay the student tariff: €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month. If you are over 30 years old, you can't get the student tariff, so you pay the same price as everyone else.
- **[If you are self-employed](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income. The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. You pay for health insurance by [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) every month.[^8]
- **[If you are an apprentice](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-apprentices)** (*[[Azubi]]*) and you earn €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month or less, you get free public health insurance. Your employer pays for it.[^48]
- **[If you are unemployed](/guides/german-health-insurance/when-unemployed)**, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. When you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you sometimes get [one month of free health insurance](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance).

The cost of public health insurance is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).

### What public insurance covers

Public health insurance covers **all necessary healthcare**. All important treatments and medical prescriptions are covered. There is no limit on the cost of treatments.

Public health insurance covers "economic, sufficient, necessary and appropriate" healthcare. This means that it usually pays for the cheapest treatment that works. It also means that optional, aesthetic treatments are not covered. For example, it does not cover tooth whitening.

Public health insurance also covers your children and your unemployed spouse [for free](#free-health-insurance). This is called *[[Familienversicherung]]*.

When you go to the doctor, you show your [insurance card](/glossary/Gesundheitskarte), and they charge your *[[Krankenkasse]]* directly. If a treatment is not covered, you know before you start. There are no surprise costs.

Public health insurance is almost completely free to use. There is sometimes a small [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung): €5 to €10 per treatment or prescription.[^70]

Essential dental care like wisdom teeth removal is covered. You also get 2 free dental check-ups every year. It does not cover tooth cleanings. You can get [dental insurance](/glossary/Zahnzusatzversicherung) to get better coverage.

Glasses and contact lenses [are rarely covered](/guides/eyeglasses). You must pay for them yourself.

### Benefits of public health insurance

- **The cost is proportional to your income**  
    If you have a low income, you pay less. This is great if you have an unstable income, if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), or if you retire. If you just [started your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or if your income is not stable, choose public health insurance.[^27]
- **It's cheap for students**  
    Students pay around €{{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}} per month until they are 30 years old. If you are under 30 years old, public is usually the best option.[^59]
- **It covers your family for free**  
    Your children and your unemployed spouse get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Private health insurance charges for each person you cover. If you have more than 2 children, public is usually the cheapest option.[^12]
- **It's easy to use**  
    When you go to the doctor, you show your [insurance card](/glossary/Gesundheitskarte), and you get healthcare. You never need to think about coverage, [deductibles](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung) or reimbursement. There is no paperwork; it just works.
- **It's not tied to your health**  
    You don't pay more if you have serious health conditions, or if you use your health insurance all the time.

### Disadvantages of public health insurance

- **It's expensive if you have a high income**  
    If you have a high income, you pay more. If you are young and healthy when you join, private health insurance can be better *and* cheaper.[^58]
- **It's harder to get doctor appointments**[^13]  
    It's hard to find a psychotherapist, psychiatrist, gynaecologist, paediatrician or urologist. Those who accept public health insurance are booked for weeks or months. If you want to see a doctor quickly, private health insurance is much better.
- **It does not cover special treatments**  
    Public health insurance covers *necessary* care. You get the most cost-effective treatment.[^43] If you want fancier treatments, you must pay for the price difference. For example, it only covers amalgam tooth fillings, not fancy composite fillings. It only covers basic teeth cleanings, twice per year. Eyeglasses are rarely covered. If you want better coverage and better treatment, choose private health insurance.[^81]

### Best public health insurance

[Public health insurers](/glossary/Krankenkasse) have almost the same cost and coverage.[^85] The price difference is less than €20 per month after taxes. The biggest difference is customer service.[^15]

If you need an English-speaking public health insurer, choose [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk). Barmer has the best English-language support and service for immigrants.[^57] Techniker Krankenkasse is also [very good](/guides/techniker-krankenkasse-review), and a little cheaper.{{ fail_on('2025-12-31') }}

The most important question is public or private health insurance.[^51] [Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you decide. They can get you cheaper health insurance *and* better coverage.

## Private health insurance

13% of Germans have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).[^2] You can get private health insurance if...

- You are and employee and you earn over €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year[^3]
- or you are self-employed
- or you are a student
- or you are a civil servant (*Beamter*)[^31]

Everyone else must get [public health insurance](#public-health-insurance).

### Cost of private health insurance

Your employer pays half of your health insurance. If you are self-employed, you pay the full price yourself.[^18] You pay for health insurance by [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) every month.[^8]

The cost depends on 4 things:

- **Your age when you join**  
    Young people pay less. The insurer saves a part of your payments for old age. If you join when you are young, you pay less when you are old. If you plan to leave Germany after a few years, you can get health insurance without old age provisions. It's much cheaper. If you are over 45 years old, public health insurance usually makes more sense.[^28]
- **Your health condition when you join**  
    If you have no health insurance history, you must get a health check at the doctor.[^44] If you have pre-existing health problems, insurers charge more or reject you.[^9] After you join, if you get really sick and use your insurance all the time, the price does not change, and they can't kick you out.
- **The coverage you choose**  
    You can get the best coverage or the lowest price. To cover your spouse and children, you must pay more.
- **Your [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung)**  
    A high deductible means lower monthly payments, but it also means paying out of pocket for most of your healthcare.

**[Quick price estimation ➞](/out/feather-private-estimate)**

You can get really cheap private health insurance. You have low monthly payments, but you pay more when you get healthcare. Usually, there is a high [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung), and you get a yearly discount if you don't use your health insurance.[^17]

You can also pay more and get the best coverage. You have higher monthly payments, but there is no deductible.

A young, healthy employee could pay just €250 per month for private insurance.[^62] Some insurers also have discounts for students.

The cost of private health insurance is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).

### Benefits of private health insurance

- **Cheaper than public for high earners**[^19]  
    If you have a high income, private is usually cheaper than public. You can also pay a similar price, but get better coverage.
- **Faster doctor appointments**  
    You can get an appointment in days instead of weeks. Try it yourself: go on [Doctolib](https://www.doctolib.de/), and look for the earliest doctor appointment. Try again with private health insurance. It's really hard to find a psychiatrist, a gynaecologist or a paediatrician with public health insurance. It's much easier with private health insurance.
- **You choose your coverage**  
    Your insurance can cover dental care, travel health insurance, special medication and special treatments. You can pay more every month for the best coverage. If you choose lower coverage and a high [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung), you pay less every month.[^17]
- **You pay less when you don't use it**  
    Many private health insurers have a no-claims bonus. If you don't use your health insurance, you get money back every year. If you never get sick, you can save a lot of money. In 2024, I got a €640 refund.

### Disadvantages of private health insurance

- **It discourages getting healthcare**  
    You usually have a yearly [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung). You pay for healthcare yourself until you reach that deductible. After that, the insurer pays for your healthcare. If you are below the deductible, you might ignore small health problems instead of paying €50 to €150 to see a doctor.
- **You pay, then you get reimbursed**  
    When you go to the doctor, you pay for it, and your health insurance reimburses you later. This is more effort and more paperwork. You also need enough money to pay for medical emergencies, even if you get reimbursed later.
- **It does not adjust to your income**  
    If your income changes, your health insurance costs the same. For example, if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), your business fails or you retire, your health insurance does not get cheaper. Public health insurance is a much safer option, because the cost is proportional to your income.
- **They can reject you**  
    If you have serious health problems, they can reject you. If you had psychotherapy, they usually reject you. If you have problems like HIV, severe asthma, diabetes or obesity, they usually reject you, or sometimes charge a lot more. They can also refuse to cover healthcare related to a pre-existing health problem.[^75] If you have pre-existing health problems, public health insurance might be your only option.[^6]
- **You can be stuck with private**  
    It's hard to switch from private to public health insurance. If you are over 55 years old, it's almost impossible. You can be stuck with a private insurance that you can't afford. You can sometimes switch to a cheaper private health insurance.[^72]

### What private insurance covers

The coverage depends on the plan you choose. **Necessary healthcare is always covered.** The coverage is usually equal or better to public health insurance.

The overall coverage is unlimited. There is no yearly cost limit. If you get cancer and the treatment costs millions of euros, your insurance pays for everything. Some treatments might have [deductibles](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung) or yearly limits. For example, some plans have coverage limits for psychotherapy.[^60] A [broker](#insurance-brokers) can help you choose a plan that fits your needs.

You can customize your coverage. For example, your insurance can cover extra services like dental care, [eyeglasses](/guides/eyeglasses) and laser eye surgery. It can cover better dental implants, a better wheelchair, or a better hospital room. You can also get lower coverage to pay less every month.

You have more healthcare options, because you can visit doctors and therapists that don't accept public health insurance. Doctors often give priority to patients with private health insurance.

With private health insurance, you usually pay for healthcare yourself, and get reimbursed by the insurance company. For big, expensive treatments, the insurance company pays the doctor directly. This is different from public health insurance, where you just show your [insurance card](/glossary/Gesundheitskarte) and get treated.

### Best private health insurance

There are thousands of private health insurance options. There are huge differences between options. **The best option depends on your situation.**

Do not choose private health insurance yourself. It's a really bad idea. The best way to choose is to [ask a health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers). Their help is free.

[Feather](/out/feather-private) sells private health insurance. They are excellent, but they only sell insurance from a few companies. To compare all insurance options, [talk to a broker](#insurance-brokers).

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) sells their own private health insurance. It's rarely the best option.[^77] Don't choose Ottonova directly; [ask a broker](#insurance-brokers) to help you. If Ottonova is a good option for you, they will tell you.[^76]

## Free health insurance

Your parents' insurance covers you for free if...

- Your parents have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)
- and you are under 23 years old (under 25 years old if you are a student)
- and your total income is under €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month (€{{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month for a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob))
- and you are not self-employed full time
- and you are not an apprentice (*[[Azubi]]*)[^53]

Your spouse's insurance covers you for free if...[^34]

- Your spouse has [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)
- and your total income is under €{{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month (€{{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}} per month for a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob))
- and you are not self-employed full time[^37]
- and you are not a apprentice (*[[Azubi]]*)[^53]

Your [health insurance from another EU country](#insurance-from-other-eu-countries) covers you if...

- You are visiting Germany
- or you are a student and you have no income[^42]

Your employer pays for your health insurance if...[^48]

- You are an apprentice (*[[Azubi]]*)
- and you earn €{{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month or less

The state pays for your public health insurance if...[^45]

- You get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)
- or you get *[[Bürgergeld]]*
- or you get *[[Elterngeld]]* (in some cases)

[When you lose your job](/guides/german-health-insurance/when-unemployed), your public health insurance is sometimes free for 1 month (*nachgehender Leistungsanspruch*). This happens automatically; you don't need to apply for it.

## Other options

### Expat health insurance

[[Expat health insurance]] is a temporary health insurance. It covers medical emergencies before you can get public or private health insurance. You can sometimes use it to apply for your first visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^5] You can't use it to change or renew an existing residence permit.[^29]

- **[If you are a freelancer](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)**, use expat insurance to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).[^6] Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you get your residence permit. If you wait too long, you can be stuck with expat insurance. This is a really bad idea.
- **[If you are a student](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students)**, public health insurance is a little more expensive than expat insurance, but it's *much* better. Switch to public health insurance *maximum* 3 months after you start university.[^14] If you wait too long, you can be stuck with expat insurance. This is a really bad idea.
- **[If you are an employee](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees)**, you might need expat insurance to apply for an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte). You must switch to public or private health insurance when you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).

Don't stay on expat health insurance. It's a really bad idea. Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as possible. The coverage is bad and the price raises quickly.[^26] You can rarely use expat insurance for more than 5 years.[^22]

If you develop a health condition while you have expat insurance, it can be really hard to find long-term health insurance, because all insurers will refuse to cover you. You can end up with a really expensive health insurance.

If you want to stay in Germany for a long time, don't stay on expat insurance. It's a bad idea because...

- **The price goes up faster**  
    The cost of expat insurance rises really quickly. If your expat insurance stays valid, it gets more and more expensive. In the long term, public and private health insurance are cheaper.[^10]
- **The coverage is not as good**  
    Check-ups and dentist visits are rarely covered.[^26] You usually pay a [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung) for basic treatments. Long term treatments (like cancer) are 100% covered, without any deductible.
- **They can stop covering you**  
    Insurers can end your contract, and refuse to keep covering you. It can be hard to find another health insurance.[^66]

Get expat health insurance from a [health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers). [Feather](/out/feather-expats) and [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats) sell expat insurance, but brokers compare all options from all insurers.

**[List of expat insurance options ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-a-visa-application#expat-health-insurance-options)**

### Travel health insurance

Travel health insurance covers medical emergencies when you visit another country. It does not cover therapy, long-term treatments, health check-ups or pre-existing conditions.

- **[If you visit Germany](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-a-visa-application#for-a-schengen-visa)**, travel insurance covers you during your trip. You need travel health insurance to get a [[Schengen visa]]. It does not cover you after you [move to Germany](/guides/moving-to-berlin). It's rarely valid for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.
- **If you move to Germany**, travel health insurance is not valid. You must get public, private or expat health insurance.
- **If you live in Germany**, travel health insurance covers medical emergencies when you when you travel to other countries. It costs around €40 per year.[^78] If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), it usually includes travel insurance.

You can get travel health insurance from [Feather](/out/feather-travel), [Envivas](https://www.envivas.de/en/insurance/travelling-abroad) or [Allianz](https://www.allianzdirect.de/reiseversicherung/). Your [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) might include travel insurance. Some banks accounts like [N26 Metal](/out/n26-metal) include travel insurance.

### Insurance from other EU countries

If you come from another EU country, your health insurance might cover you in Germany. You can only get treatments that are covered by German public health insurance.[^32] It does not cover repatriation if you are sick. For that, you need [travel health insurance](#travel-health-insurance).[^24]

**If you visit Germany**, your EU health insurance covers medical emergencies.[^23] It only covers treatments that can't wait until you go home. For example, if you break your ankle on a hike, it covers the hospital visit. If you stay longer than 3 months, you must get German health insurance.[^38]

**If you study in Germany**, your EU health insurance covers you until you graduate, and during your job search after graduation.[^39] It covers all treatments that can't wait until after your studies.

If health insurance is cheaper in your home country, EHIC is a good way to save money, because you don't need German health insurance. Apply for EHIC with your health insurance in your home country.[^16]

If you start working in Germany, your EHIC stops working, and you must get German health insurance.[^42]

**[More information about EHIC ➞](https://www.health-insurance.de/student/eu-eea/)**

## Public or private insurance?

Do not choose your insurance yourself. There is no benefit. [Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

### Choose public health insurance if...

- **You don't have a stable income**  
    If you are not sure you will always have a high income, public health insurance is safer. It costs a percentage of your income, so if you make less, your pay less. If you just [started your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or your income is below €30,000, choose public health insurance.[^27]
- **You want something that just works**  
    Just show your card and get healthcare. It takes longer to get an appointment, but you don't have to deal with any paperwork.
- **You want more than 2 children**  
    Public health insurance covers your children [for free](/glossary/Familienversicherung). Private health insurance charges extra for each child. If you have 1 or 2 children, private health insurance can be cheaper anyway.[^12]
- **You are a student under 30 years old**  
    The student tariff is a really good deal.[^59] There is sometimes cheaper private health insurance, but the coverage is much worse.
- **You have pre-existing health problems**  
    Private health insurers might charge more or refuse to cover you. Even getting psychotherapy can disqualify you. Public health insurance is usually forced to accept you.

Public health insurance is **the safest option**, because you can choose private health insurance later.[^82]

### Choose private health insurance if...

- **You have stable income**  
    Private health insurance makes sense if you know you will always have a high income.
- **You want faster doctor appointments**  
    It's much easier to find a doctor, a psychotherapist, a paediatrician or a gynaecologist.
- **You want the best coverage**  
    Private health insurance lets you pay more and get the best coverage for you and your family.
- **You want better treatment**  
    You can choose a specific doctor, or a specific kind of treatment. For example, you can get innovative therapy or medication that is not yet covered by public health insurance.[^73] It can cover better dental implants, a better wheelchair, or a better hospital room.
- **You plan to leave Germany in a few years**  
    You can get short-term private health insurance. It's up to 50% cheaper, because there is no old age provision.[^74]
- **You can't choose public health insurance**  
    If you are a freelancer or a student from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country, public health insurers might reject you. Private health insurance might be your only option.

Private health insurance is **a risky decision**. If you are not happy, it's really hard to switch to public health insurance. Never choose private health insurance yourself. Always [ask a broker](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

### Choose expat health insurance if...

- **You are a foreign student over 30 years old**  
    If you come from a non-[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country, it's often the only option.
- **You need temporary insurance coverage**  
    Expat health insurance covers you until your public health insurance starts working. You might need it to apply for a German visa.
- **You have no other choice**  
    If you are self-employed and you have pre-existing health problems, it might be your only option. Expat health insurance is usually the cheapest option. It's a bad long-term solution, but it might be the only insurance you can afford.
- **You apply for an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)**  
    Expat health insurance is perfect for this. When you [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), switch to public or private health insurance.

Expat health insurance is **rarely the best option**. Always [ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) if it makes sense for you.

German embassies and consulates sometimes accept expat health insurance when you apply for a visa.[^33] Get public or private health insurance if you can.

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* sometimes accepts expat health insurance when you apply for your first [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). It does not work when you change or renew your residence permit.[^21]

**[Health insurance for a visa application ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-a-visa-application)**

### Choose travel health insurance if...

- **You are a tourist**  
    Travel insurance covers medical emergencies while you travel. It's cheap.
- **You apply for a [[Schengen visa]]**  
    You need valid health insurance to apply for the Schengen visa. [HanseMerkur Visa Plus](/out/hansemerkur-travel) works well for this.

**[Health insurance for a Schengen visa ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-a-visa-application#for-a-schengen-visa)**

### Insurance brokers

Don't choose health insurance yourself. Ask a broker to help you. They help you avoid mistakes. They can get you better, cheaper health insurance. Their help is free.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestionStatic.html' %}

Talk to a broker (*Makler*), not an agent (*Vertreter*). Brokers are independent. They recommend health insurance from different companies. Agents only sell insurance from specific companies.

Choose a broker who works with expats. Your situation is different, and your broker must know how to help you.

**[Feather](/out/feather)** is an agent, not a broker. They have an excellent service, but they only sell insurance from a few companies.[^61] They might not sell the best insurance for your needs.

**[Ottonova](/out/ottonova)** sells their own insurance. It's rarely the best option.[^83] Even if you get Ottonova, it's better to get it through a broker. See my [review of Ottonova](/guides/ottonova-review).

I work with Seamus Wolf. He is honest and knowledgeable, and he speaks English.

## How to get insured

### 1. Understand your options

Use my [recommendation tool](#your-options) to know your options. There are two insurance systems and hundreds of options. The best option depends on your situation.

### 2. Ask an expert to choose

Don't choose health insurance yourself. Always [ask a broker](#insurance-brokers) to help you. They ask you the right questions, look at all the options, and help you find the best one. You can get better, cheaper health insurance. Their help is free.

If you choose the wrong health insurance, your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application can be rejected. If you choose the cheapest insurance, you might save money now but lose a lot of money later.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

If you are self-employed, never choose health insurance yourself. It's a complicated decision, and you can make expensive mistakes.

### 3. Apply for health insurance

The process is different with each insurer. Your health insurance broker can take care of this.

You only need an ID document and a photo for your insurance card. You do not need a German address or an *[[Anmeldung]]*.[^63]

If you choose private health insurance, you usually need a health check from a doctor.[^44] It costs around €250.[^30]{{ fail_on('2027-01-01') }}

If you are self-employed and new in Germany, it can be hard to get health insurance. Public and private health insurers can reject you.

### 4. Get your documents

Once you are insured, you get...

- **A [health insurance card](/glossary/Gesundheitskarte)**  
    When you go to the doctor, bring it with you. It's also a proof of health insurance when you travel to other [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) countries.
- **A [[Mitgliedsbescheinigung]]**  
    It's a proof of health insurance. Use it to apply for a visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).
- **A [[Sozialversicherungsnummer]]**  
    Give it to your employer. If you get private health insurance, you do not get a *Sozialversicherungsnummer* automatically. Your employer can also request it for you.[^80] You can also [contact the *Deutsche Rentenversicherung*](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/DRV/DE/Beratung-und-Kontakt/Kontakt/Anschriften-Uebersicht/anschriften_uebersicht_detail.html) and ask for it.

If you are a student, your health insurer will tell your school that you are insured (the *M10 Meldung*). It's done digitally; you don't need to do anything. It takes around 3 days.[^86]

### 5. Pay every month

If you have public health insurance, you pay out of your paycheck every month. If you have private health insurance or you are self-employed, you pay by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung) or [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).[^35]

## What to do next

- [ ] **Tell your employer**  
    When you change your health insurance, tell your employer.[^84] Tell the human resources department.
- [ ] **[Get liability insurance](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    [Liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) is the second most important insurance. Most Germans have it. I got mine from [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht).
- [ ] **Get travel health insurance**  
    It covers you when you travel outside of Germany. It costs around €25 to €40 per year.[^78]{{ fail_on('2026-03-01') }} You can get travel insurance from [Feather](/out/feather-travel), [Envivas](https://www.envivas.de/en/insurance/travelling-abroad) or [Allianz](https://www.allianzdirect.de/reiseversicherung/). Your [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) might include travel insurance. Some banks accounts like [N26 Metal](/out/n26-metal) include travel insurance.
- [ ] **[Become an organ donor](/guides/organ-donor)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    It's really easy. It can save another person's life.
