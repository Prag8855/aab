You need it to apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and before you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).

This guide explains how German health insurance works, how to choose the best health insurance for your needs.

## How to choose health insurance

1. **Understand [your options](#your-options)**  
    Use my [recommendation tool](#your-options) or keep reading this guide. There are two insurance systems and hundreds of options. The best option depends on your situation.
2. **[Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    Don't choose insurance yourself; it can be an expensive mistake. Get free help from a health insurance broker.
3. **Apply for health insurance**  
    Each insurer has a different application process. With private health insurance, you usually need a health check from a doctor. It costs around 250€.[^30]{{ fail_on('2026-06-01') }}
4. **Get your documents**  
    Once you are insured, you get a health insurance card, a *[[Mitgliedsbescheinigung]]* and a *[[Sozialversicherungsnummer]]*. Tell your employer about your new health insurance. Use the *Mitgliedsbescheinigung* as a proof of insurance for your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.
5. **Pay every month**  
    If you are an employee, the insurance payments come out of your paycheck every month. Everyone else pays by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung).

## Your options

### Health insurance for employees

Your health insurance is not tied to your job. Your employer does not decide what health insurance you can have. If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance.

**If you earn over {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can choose public or private health insurance.[^3] Public health insurance costs [around {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag).[^1] Private health insurance will probably be cheaper for you.[^56]

**If you earn {{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ to {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can only choose [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^3] It costs [around {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag). Doctors and civil servants can also choose private health insurance.[^31]

**If you earn less than {{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can only choose public health insurance. It costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). Doctors and civil servants can also choose private health insurance.[^31]

**If you have a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob)**, you can choose public or private health insurance. You might get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. Your employer does not help you pay for health insurance.[^36]

**If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job)**, you might get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month.

If you move from a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country, your health insurance from your previous country usually covers you until you start working.[^57]

If you move from a non-EU country, you might need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^42] It covers you until you start working. When you start working, you must switch to public or private health insurance. A [health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers) can arrange this for you.

Your employer can help you get public health insurance. This is not a good idea. They don't choose the best insurance for you; they choose what is easy for them.[^7]

### Health insurance for students

**If you are under 25 years old**, you might get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month. Public health insurance is usually the best option for students.[^59] You can also get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), but it's usually a little more expensive.

**If you are under 30 years old**, you pay the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month. Public health insurance is usually the best option for students.[^59] You also can get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), but it's usually a little more expensive.

**If you are over 30 years old**, you can't get the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around [{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag).[^25] [Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) might be cheaper for you. You can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

**If you are a foreign student**, you might need temporary health insurance before school starts. If you are from the EU, you can use [health insurance from your home country](#insurance-from-other-eu-countries). If you are not from the EU, you usually need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).

**If you are self-employed**, and your income is over {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you are treated [like a self-employed person](#health-insurance-for-freelancers). You can't get the student tariff and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). If you are young, [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) usually makes the most sense.[^58]

**If you have a job**, you work over 20 hours per week, and you earn more than {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you are treated [like a normal employee](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^46] You can't get the student tariff, and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). There are different rules for [internships](#health-insurance-for-an-internship) and [apprenticeships](#health-insurance-for-an-apprenticeship).

[Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. They can help you find the cheapest health insurance. Their help is free.

### Health insurance for unemployed people

**If you get [[ALG I]], [[Bürgergeld]] or [[Elterngeld]]**, health insurance is free. The state pays for it.[^11] If you had private health insurance, you must usually switch to public health insurance.[^41]

**If you don't get ALG I, Bürgergeld or Elterngeld**, you can choose public or private health insurance. With public health insurance, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month.[^40] The cost of private health insurance is not related to your income.

### Health insurance for freelancers

If you are self-employed, you can choose public or private health insurance.[^4]

**[Public health insurance](#public-health-insurance)** costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The minimum cost is around [{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) per month. The maximum cost is around [{{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) per month. You can't get the student tariff, you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance), and you can't health insurance from another EU country.[^37]

**[Private health insurance](#private-health-insurance)** is usually cheaper. The cost is based on your age and your health when you sign up. If you earn less than 30,000€ per year, private health insurers might reject you.[^55] Don't get private health insurance if you have an unstable income.[^27]

**[Expat health insurance](#expat-health-insurance)** is the cheapest option. This is supposed to be temporary health insurance. You can use it to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa). Staying on expat insurance is a really bad idea. Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you can.

Don't choose health insurance yourself. It's a *really* bad idea when you are self-employed. The best option depends on your citizenship, your income, your health, and your plans for the future. [Ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

If you are a freelance artist, journalist, publicist or influencer, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It's always worth it.

**[How to apply for the KSK ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

### Health insurance for an apprenticeship

**If your earn less than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**, you get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Your employer pays for it.[^48]

**If you earn more than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**, you can only get public health insurance.[^54] It costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*).[^52] You can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).[^53]

### Health insurance for an internship

**If it's a voluntary internship**, you have [the same options as an employee](#health-insurance-for-employees). You can sometimes get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

**If it's a mandatory internship**, the rules are different.

If the internship is during your studies:

- If you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month or less, your health insurance is free. Your employer pays for it.[^49]
- If you earn 556€ per month or less, you can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay ???€ per month.
- If you earn over 556€ per month, ???

If the internship is before or after your studies:

- If you earn more than {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you pay [the same price as other employees](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^43]
- If you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ to {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you pay [the same price as other students](#health-insurance-for-students).[^51]
- If you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month or less, you get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Your employer pays for it.
- If it's an unpaid internship, you must pay for your own health insurance.[^50] You might get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

## Public health insurance

89% of Germans have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^2] It's often your only option.

Public health insurance is provided by [non-profit insurance funds](/glossary/Krankenkasse), not by the state. The cost and coverage are almost the same for all public health insurers.

### Cost of public health insurance

Public health insurance costs {{GKV_BASE_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income, plus around {{GKV_AVG_ZUSATZBEITRAG}}% for the [insurer surcharge](/glossary/Zusatzbeitrag), and {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MIN_RATE}}% to {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MAX_RATE}}% for [long-term care insurance](/glossary/Pflegeversicherung). If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

**If you are an employee**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MIN_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month. Health insurance payments are taken from your paycheck each month.

**If you are unemployed**, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. When you lose your job, you sometimes get [one month of free health insurance](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance).

**If you are a student**, you usually pay the student tariff: {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month. If you are over 30 years old, you can't get the student tariff, so you pay the same price as everyone else.

**If you are a trainee** (*[[Azubi]]*) and you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month or less, you get free public health insurance. Your employer pays for it.[^48]

**If you are self-employed**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income. The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. You pay for health insurance by [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) every month.[^8]

### Free health insurance

Your parents' health insurance covers you for free if...

- Your parents have public health insurance
- and you are under 23 years old (under 25 years old if you are a student)
- and your total income is under {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month ({{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month for a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob))
- and you are not self-employed full time
- and you are not a trainee (*[[Azubi]]*)[^53]

Your spouse's health insurance covers you for free if...[^34]

- Your spouse has public health insurance
- and your total income is under {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month ({{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month for a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob))
- and you are not self-employed full time
- and you are not a trainee (*[[Azubi]]*)[^53]

Your health insurance from another EU country covers you if...[^39]

- Your total income is under {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month ({{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month for a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob))
- or you are a student, and you work 20 hours per week or less[^38]

Your employer pays for your health insurance if...[^48]

- You are a trainee (*[[Azubi]]*)
- and you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month or less

The state pays for your health insurance if...[^45]

- You get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)
- or you get *[[Bürgergeld]]*
- or you get *[[Elterngeld]]*

When you lose your job, you sometimes get [one month of free health insurance](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance).

If you are a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) citizen, you can sometimes use your [insurance from your home country](#insurance-from-other-eu-countries). This is great if you get free health insurance in your home country.

### What public insurance covers

Public health insurance covers **all necessary healthcare**. Important treatments and medical prescriptions are always covered. There is a small deductible (5€ to 10€ per month) for some prescriptions. There is no other deductible. There is no coverage limit.

When you go to the doctor, you give your insurance card, and they charge your *[[Krankenkasse]]* directly. If a treatment is not covered, you know before you start. There are no surprise costs.

Public health insurance covers essential dental care, like removing your wisdom teeth. You also get 2 free dental check-ups every year. It does not cover tooth cleanings. Many people also get [dental insurance](/glossary/Zahnzusatzversicherung) to get better coverage.

Glasses and contact lenses [are rarely covered](/guides/eyeglasses). You must pay for them yourself.

Public health insurance also covers your children and your unemployed spouse for free. This is called *[[Familienversicherung]]*.

### Benefits of public health insurance

- **The cost is proportional to your income**  
    If you have a low income, you pay less. This is great if you have an unstable income, if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), or if you retire. If you just [started your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany), public health insurance is a safer option.[^27]
- **It's cheap for students**  
    Students pay around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month until they are 30 years old. Usually, public is the best option for students.[^59]
- **It covers your family for free**  
    Your children and your unemployed spouse get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Private health insurance charges for each person you cover. If you have children, public health insurance is usually the best option.[^12]
- **It's easy to use**  
    When you go to the doctor, you show your insurance card, and you get healthcare. You never need to think about coverage, deductibles or reimbursement. There is no paperwork; it just works.
- **It's not tied to your health**  
    You pay the same price, even if you are very sick when you join. You don't pay more if you use your health insurance all the time.

### Disadvantages of public health insurance

- **It's expensive if you have a high income**  
    If you have a high income, you pay more. If you are young and healthy, private health insurance can be better *and* cheaper.[^63]
- **It's harder to get doctor appointments**[^13]  
    It's hard to find a psychotherapist, psychiatrist, gynaecologist, paediatrician or urologist. Those who accept public health insurance are booked for weeks or months. If you want to see a doctor quickly, private health insurance is better.
- **It does not cover special treatments**  
    Public health insurance covers *necessary* care. If you want fancier treatments, you must pay for the price difference. For example, it only covers amalgam tooth fillings, not fancy composite fillings. It only covers basic teeth cleanings, twice per year. Eyeglasses are rarely covered. With private health insurance, you can choose better coverage.

### Best public health insurance

They are all the same. The cost and coverage are almost the same. The maximum price difference is less than 20€ per month. The biggest difference is customer service.[^15]

If you need an English-speaking health insurer, choose [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) or [Barmer](/out/barmer). I had Techniker Krankenkasse for 6 years. It's [really good](/guides/techniker-krankenkasse-review), and it's one of the cheapest options.{{ fail_on('2025-12-31') }}.

The most important question: is public the best option for you? [Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. The can help you get a cheaper health insurance *and* better coverage.

## Private health insurance

11% of Germans have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).[^16] You can get private health insurance if...

- You are and employee and you earn over {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year[^3]
- or you are self-employed
- or you are a student, a trainee (*[[Azubi]]*), a doctor or a public servant

Everyone else must get [public health insurance](#public-health-insurance).

### Cost of private health insurance

Your employer pays half of your health insurance. If you are self-employed, you pay the full price yourself.[^18] You pay for health insurance by [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) every month.[^8]

The cost depends on 4 things:

- **Your age when you join**  
    Young people pay less. The insurer also saves part of your payments for when you are old. If you join when you are young, your payments are lower when you are old. If you plan to leave Germany after a few years, you can get health insurance without old age provisions. It's much cheaper. If you are over 40 years old, public health insurance makes more sense.[^28]
- **Your health condition when you join**  
    Usually, you must get a health check at the doctor. If you have pre-existing health problems, insurers charge more or reject you.[^9] After you join, if you get really sick and use your insurance all the time, the price does not change, and they can't kick you out.
- **The coverage you choose**  
    You can get the best coverage or the lowest price. To cover your spouse and children, you must pay more.
- **Your [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung)**  
    A high deductible means lower monthly payments, but it also means paying out of pocket for most of your healthcare.

**[Quick price estimation ➞](/out/feather-private-estimate)**

You can get really cheap private health insurance. You have low monthly payments, but you pay more when you get healthcare. Usually, there is a high [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung), and you get a yearly discount if you don't use your health insurance.[^17]

You can also pay more and get the best coverage. You have higher monthly payments, but there is no deductible.

A young, healthy employee could pay just 250€ per month for private insurance.[^62] Some insurers also have discounts for students.

### Benefits of private health insurance

- **Cheaper than public for high earners**[^19]
- **Faster doctor appointments**  
    You can get an appointment in days instead of weeks. Try it yourself: go on [Doctolib](https://www.doctolib.de/), and look for the earliest doctor appointment. Try again with private health insurance. It's really hard to find a psychiatrist, a gynaecologist or a paediatrician with public health insurance. It's much easier with private health insurance.
- **You choose your coverage**  
    Your insurance can cover dental care, travel insurance, special treatments etc. You can pay more for the best coverage. You can also choose lower coverage and a high deductible to pay less.[^17] 
- **You pay less when you don't use it**  
    Many private health insurers have a no-claims bonus. If you don't use your health insurance, you get money back every year. If you never get sick, you can save a lot of money.

### Disadvantages of private health insurance

- **It discourages getting healthcare**  
    You usually have a yearly [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung). You pay for healthcare yourself until you reach that deductible. After that, the insurer pays for your healthcare. If you are below the deductible, you might ignore small health problems instead of paying 50€ to 150€ to see a doctor.
- **You pay, then you get reimbursed**  
    When you go to the doctor, you pay for it, and your health insurance reimburses you later. This is more effort and more paperwork. You also need enough money to pay for your medical bills, even if you get reimbursed later.
- **It does not adjust to your income**  
    If your income changes, your health insurance costs the same. This is a problem if you have a bad year. Public health insurance is a much safer option, because the cost is proportional to your income.
- **They can reject you**  
    If you have serious health problems, they reject you. If you had psychotherapy, they usually reject you. If you have problems like AIDS, severe asthma, diabetes or obesity, they could also reject you, or charge a lot more. If you have pre-existing health conditions, public health insurance might be your only option.[^6]
- **You can be stuck with private**  
    It's hard to switch from private to public health insurance. You can be stuck with an expensive health insurance, and have no way to switch to public.

### What private insurance covers

Private health insurance covers the same things as public health insurance, and often more. **Necessary healthcare is always covered.**

The covered amount is unlimited.[^60] For example, if you get cancer, the treatment can cost millions of euros. Your insurance pays for everything.

With private health insurance, you can choose how much coverage you want. For example, it can cover extra services like dental care, [eyeglasses](/guides/eyeglasses) and laser eye surgery. You can cover less, but pay less every month.

You have more healthcare options, because you can visit doctors and therapists that don't accept public health insurance. Doctors often give priority to patients with private health insurance.

With private health insurance, you usually pay for healthcare yourself, and get reimbursed by the insurance company. For big, expensive treatments, the insurance company pays the doctor directly. This is different from public health insurance, where you just show your insurance card.

### Best private health insurance

There are big differences between private health insurance companies. Each offers very different options. **The best option depends on your situation.**

The best way to choose is to ask a health insurance broker. Their help is free. They get paid by the insurance companies when they bring new customers.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) is popular option with expats, because they offer support in English, but [they are not perfect](/guides/ottonova-review).

[Feather](/out/feather-private) also offers private health insurance. They helped me get private health insurance, and I trust them. They are a health insurance broker, not a health insurer. This means that they sell insurance from different companies. They speak English. Their insurance works for [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) applications.

**[Quick price estimation ➞](/out/feather-private-estimate)**

## Other options

### Expat health insurance

[[Expat health insurance]] is a temporary health insurance. It covers medical emergencies before you can get public or private health insurance. You can use it to apply for your first visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^5] You can't use it to change or renew an existing residence permit.[^29]

**If you are an employee**, use expat insurance to apply for an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte). You must switch to public or private health insurance when you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).

**If you are a freelancer**, use expat insurance to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).[^6] Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you get your residence permit. If you wait too long, you can be stuck with expat insurance. This is a really bad idea.

**If you are a student**, public health insurance is a little more expensive than expat insurance, but it's *much* better. Switch to public health insurance *maximum* 3 months after you start university.[^14] If you wait too long, you can be stuck with expat insurance. This is a really bad idea.

**[Health insurance for a residence permit ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**

Don't stay on expat health insurance. It's a really bad idea. Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as possible. The coverage is bad and the price raises quickly.[^26] It usually expires after 5 years.[^22]

If you develop a health condition while you have expat insurance, it can be really hard to find long-term health insurance, because all insurers will refuse to cover you. You can end up with a really expensive health insurance.

If you want to stay in Germany for a long time, staying on expat insurance is a really bad idea.

- **The price goes up faster**  
    The cost of expat insurance rises really quickly.[^22] If your expat insurance stays valid, it gets more and more expensive. In the long term, public and private health insurance are cheaper.[^10]
- **The coverage is not as good**  
    Check-ups and dentist visits are rarely covered.[^26] You usually pay a deductible for basic treatments. Long term treatments (like cancer) are 100% covered, without any deductible.

Get expat health insurance from a [health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers). [Feather](/out/feather-expats) and [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats) also sell it.

**[List of expat insurance options ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#expat-health-insurance-options)**

### Travel insurance

Travel insurance is valid **for visiting Germany**. You need it to get a [[Schengen visa]]. It's rarely valid for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.

It only covers medical emergencies, and treatments that can't wait until you go back home. It does not cover long-term treatments, health check-ups or pre-existing conditions.

You can buy travel insurance online in your home country. [HanseMerkur](/out/hansemerkur-travel)'s travel insurance is valid for a Schengen visa application.

**[Health insurance for a Schengen visa ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-schengen-visa)**

### Insurance from other EU countries

If you come from another EU country, you can use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in Germany. If you get healthcare in Germany, your health insurance in your home country pays for it.

- **If you stay in Germany temporarily**, your EHIC covers you. You do not need extra health insurance in Germany.
- **If you are an Erasmus student from another EU country**, your EHIC covers you.[^23] You can use your EHIC card even if you study in Germany for your entire degree.[^32] You do not need extra German health insurance unless you start working.
- **When you start working in Germany**, your EHIC does not cover you anymore. If you earn more than {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you must get German health insurance.[^24]

If health insurance is cheaper in your home country, using your EHIC is cheaper than getting German health insurance. You can save a lot of money every month with the EHIC.

## How to decide

There is no reason to choose your insurance yourself. [Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

### Choose public health insurance if...

- **You don't have a stable income**  
    If you are not sure you will always have a high income, public health insurance is safer. It costs a percentage of your income, so if you make less, your pay less. If you just [started your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany), choose public health insurance.[^27]
- **You want something that just works**  
    Just show your card and get healthcare. It takes longer to get an appointment, but you don't have to deal with any paperwork.
- **You have or want children**  
    Public health insurance covers your children [for free](/glossary/Familienversicherung). Private health insurance charges extra for each child.
- **You pay the student tariff**  
    The student tariff is a really good deal. If you are a student under 30 years old, public health insurance is usually the best option.[^59]

### Choose private health insurance if...

- **You have stable income**  
    Private health insurance makes sense if you have a high income for the rest of your career.
- **You want fast doctor appointments**  
    It's much easier to find a doctor.
- **You want the best coverage**  
    Private health insurance lets you pay more and get the best coverage.
- **You plan to leave Germany in a few years**  
    You can get health insurance without an old age privision. It's up to 50% cheaper.
- **You don't want children**[^20]

Do not choose health insurance to pay as little as possible. This is a bad idea.

### Choose expat health insurance if...

- **You apply for an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)**  
    Expat health insurance is ideal for this. When you [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), switch to public or private health insurance.
- **You have no choice**  
    Expat health insurance is the cheapest insurance. It's a bad long-term solution, but it might be the only health insurance you can afford.

German embassies and consulates usually accept expat health insurance for a visa application.[^33]

The [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde) *sometimes* accepts expat health insurance, but only if it's your first residence permit. Expat insurance is not accepted when you change or renew a residence permit.[^21]

**[Health insurance for a visa application ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**

### Choose travel insurance if...

- **You are visiting Germany**  
    Travel insurance covers medical emergencies while you travel. It's very cheap.
- **You apply for a [[Schengen visa]]**  
    You need valid health insurance to apply for the Schengen visa. [HanseMerkur's Visa Plus travel insurance](/out/hansemerkur-travel) works well for this.

**[Health insurance for a Schengen visa ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-schengen-visa)**

### Insurance brokers

Health insurance brokers help you choose health insurance. They help you for free. They get paid by health insurers to bring them new customers. I strongly recommend you to ask a broker to help you choose health insurance.

Always work with a broker (*Makler*), not an agent (*Vertreter*). Brokers are independent, and recommend health insurance from different companies. Agents only sell insurance from specific companies.

For example, Feather is an agent, and they mostly sell insurance from Hallesche.[^61] They are a great company and I trust them, but their recommendations are not neutral.

If you are an immigrant, choose a broker who works with expats. Your needs are different, and your broker must know how to help you.

## What to do next

### Get an insurance certificate

Once you are insured, you get a *[[Mitgliedsbescheinigung]]*, a health insurance card and a *[[Sozialversicherungsnummer]]*. Give it to your employer. Your employer needs to know about your health insurance, because the payments come directly from your paycheck. You also need this proof of insurance for your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.

### Get liability insurance

You should also get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung). It's the second most important insurance to have. Most Germans have it. There are [many types of insurance](/guides/insurance), but health and liability insurance are the most important.

I got my liability insurance from [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht). If you [ask a broker](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose health insurance, they can also help you find liability insurance.

**[How to choose liability insurance ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

### Get travel insurance

You might also need travel insurance when you visit other countries. Your private health insurance might include it. Public health insurance generally does not.

### Become an organ donor

If you are new in Germany, [register as an organ donor](/guides/organ-donor). It's really easy, and it can save another person's life.
