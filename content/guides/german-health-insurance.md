You must choose health insurance yourself. There are hundreds of options. This guide explains how German health insurance works, how to choose the best health insurance for your needs.

### Health insurance for employees

Your health insurance is not tied to your job. Your employer does not decide what health insurance you can have. If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance.

**If you earn over {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can choose public or private health insurance. Public health insurance costs [{{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag). Private health insurance is usually cheaper.[^56]

**If you earn {{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ to {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, your only option is [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It costs [{{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag). If you are a doctor or a civil servant, you can also choose private health insurance.[^31]

**If you earn less than {{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can only choose public health insurance. It costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). If you are a doctor or a civil servant, you can also choose private health insurance.[^31]

**If you have a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob)**, you can choose public or private health insurance. You might get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. Your employer does not pay half of it.[^36]

**If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job)**, you might get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month.

If you move from a non-EU country, you might need expat health insurance. It covers you before you start working. When you start working, you must switch to public or private health insurance. A health insurance broker can arrange this.[^42]

If you move from a EU country, your health insurance from your previous country usually covers you until you start working.[^57]

### Health insurance for students

**If you are under 30 years old**, you pay the student tariff: around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month for [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). You can also get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), but it's usually a little more expensive. Public health insurance is usually the best option for students.[^59] If you are under 25 years old, you can sometimes get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

**If you are over 30 years old**, you can't get the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around [{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag).[^25] [Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) might be cheaper for you. You can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

**If you are a foreign student**, you might need temporary health insurance before school starts. If you are from the EU, you can use your health insurance from your home country. If you are not from the EU, you usually need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).

**If you are self-employed**, and your income is over {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you are treated [like a self-employed person](#health-insurance-for-freelancers). You can't get the student tariff and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). If you are young, [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) usually makes the most sense.[^58]

**If you have a job**, you work over 20 hours per week, and you earn more than {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you are treated [like a normal employee](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^46] You can't get the student tariff, and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). There are different rules for [internships](#health-insurance-for-an-internship) and [apprenticeships](#health-insurance-for-an-apprenticeship).

[Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. They can help you find the cheapest health insurance. Their help is free.

### Health insurance for unemployed people

**If you get [[ALG I]], [[Bürgergeld]] or [[Elterngeld]]**, health insurance is free. The state pays for it.[^11] If you had private health insurance, you must usually switch to public health insurance.[^41]

**If you don't get ALG I, Bürgergeld or Elterngeld**, you can choose public or private health insurance. With public health insurance, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month.[^40] The cost of private health insurance is not related to your income, so it does not change.

### Health insurance for freelancers

If you are self-employed, you can choose public, private or expat health insurance.[^4] Don't choose without help. It's is a complex decision, and you can make expensive mistakes. If you choose the wrong insurance, your freelance visa application could be rejected. You really need to [talk to a health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers).

**[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)** costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The minimum cost is [{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) per month. The maximum cost is [{{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) per month. You can't get the student tariff, you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance), and you can't use your [foreign health insurance](#insurance-from-other-eu-countries).[^37]

**[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)** is usually cheaper. The cost is based on your age and your health when you sign up. If you earn less than 30,000€ per year, private health insurers might reject you.[^55]

**[Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance)** is the cheapest option. This is a short-term option. It makes sense if know that you won't stay in Germany.

If you just moved from a non-EU country, it's hard to get public health insurance. Public insurance companies can refuse to cover you.[^14] Most immigrant freelancers are forced to choose [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) or [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).

### Health insurance for an apprenticeship

If you are a trainee (*[[Azubi]]*), your only option is [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^54]

**If your earn less than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**, you get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Your employer pays for it.[^48]

**If you earn more than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**, your health insurance costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*).[^52] You can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).[^53]

### Health insurance for an internship

**If it's a voluntary internship**, you have [the same options as an employee](#health-insurance-for-employees). You can sometimes get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

**If it's a mandatory internship**, the rules are different.

If the internship is during your studies:

- If you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month or less, your health insurance is free. Your employer pays for it.[^49]
- If you earn 556€ per month or less, you can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay ???€ per month.
- If you earn over 556€ per month, ???

If the internship is before or after your studies:

- If you earn more than {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you pay [the same price as other employees](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^43]
- If you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ to {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you pay [the same price as other students](#health-insurance-for-students).[^51]
- If you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month or less, you get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Your employer pays for it.
- If it's an unpaid internship, you must pay for your own health insurance.[^50] You might get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

## Public health insurance

89% of German residents have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^2] For many people, it's the only option.

Public health insurance is not provided by the state. It's provided by non-profit insurance funds called *Krankenkassen*. The cost and coverage is almost the same for all *Krankenkassen*.

### Cost of public health insurance

Public health insurance costs {{GKV_BASE_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income, plus around {{GKV_AVG_ZUSATZBEITRAG}}% for the [insurer surcharge](/glossary/Zusatzbeitrag), and {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MIN_RATE}}% to {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MAX_RATE}}% for [long-term care insurance](/glossary/Pflegeversicherung). If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

**If you are an employee**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MIN_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month.

**If you are self-employed or unemployed**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income. The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month.

**If you are a student**, you usually pay the student tariff: {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month. If you are over 30 years old, you can't get the student tariff, so you pay the same price as everyone else.

You can sometimes get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

### What is covered

Public health insurance covers **all necessary healthcare**. Important treatments and medical prescriptions are always covered. There is a small deductible (5€ to 10€ per month) for some prescriptions. There is no other deductible. There is no coverage limit.

When you go to the doctor, you give your insurance card, and they charge your *[[Krankenkasse]]* directly. If a treatment is not covered, you know before you start. There are no surprise costs.

Public health insurance covers essential dental care, like removing your wisdom teeth. You also get 2 free dental check-ups every year. It does not cover tooth cleanings. Many people also get [dental insurance](/glossary/Zahnzusatzversicherung) to get better coverage.

Glasses and contact lenses [are rarely covered](/guides/eyeglasses). You need to pay for them yourself.

Public health insurance also covers your children and your unemployed spouse for free. This is called *[[Familienversicherung]]*.

### Benefits of public health insurance

- **The cost is proportional to your income**  
    If you have a low income, you pay less. This is great if you have an unstable income, if you lose your job, or if you retire.
- **It's cheap for students**  
    Students pay around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month until they are 30 years old. Usually, public is the best option for students.[^59]
- **It covers your family for free**  
    Your children and your unemployed spouse get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Private health insurance charges for each person you cover. If you have children, public health insurance is often the best option.[^12]
- **It's easy to use**  
    When you go to the doctor, you show your insurance card, and you get healthcare. You never need to think about coverage, deductibles or reimbursement. There is no paperwork; it just works.
- **It's not tied to your health**  
    You pay the same price, even if you are very sick when you join. You don't pay more if you use your health insurance all the time.

### Disadvantages of public health insurance

- **It's expensive if you have a high income**  
    If you earn more, you pay more. If you are young, healthy and well-paid, private health insurance is better and cheaper.[^63]
- **It's harder to get a doctor appointment**[^13]  
    It's hard to find a psychotherapist, psychiatrist, gynaecologist, paediatrician or urologist who accept public health insurance. It can take weeks or months to get an appointment. If you want to see a doctor quickly, private health insurance is better.
- **It does not cover special treatments**  
    Public health insurance covers *necessary* care. If you want fancier treatments, you must pay for the price difference. For example, it only covers amalgam tooth fillings, not fancy composite fillings. It only covers basic teeth cleanings, twice per year. Eyeglasses are rarely covered. With private health insurance, you can choose better coverage.

### Best public health insurance

All options have almost the same cost and coverage. After taxes, the price difference is less than 15€ per month. The biggest difference is customer service.[^15]

If you need an English-speaking health insurer, choose [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk) or [Barmer](/out/barmer). I had Techniker Krankenkasse for 6 years. It's [really good](/guides/techniker-krankenkasse-review), and it's one of the cheapest options.{{ fail_on('2025-12-31') }}.

The most important question: is public the best option for you? [Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. You might get much better coverage *and* a lower price.

## Private health insurance

11% of Germans have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).[^16] Most people can't get private health insurance.

### Cost of private health insurance

The cost depends on 4 things:

- **Your age when you join**  
    Young and healthy people pay less. The insurer saves part of your payments for when you are old. If you join when you are young, your payments are lower when you are old. If you plan to leave Germany after a few years, you can get health insurance without old age provisions. It's even cheaper.
- **Your health condition when you join**  
    Usually, you need to take a medical test. After you join, your health condition does not change the cost of your insurance. If you get really sick and use your insurance all the time, the price does not change.
- **The level of coverage you choose**  
    You can get the best coverage or the lowest price.
- **Your [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung)**  
    A high deductible means lower monthly payments, but it also means paying out of pocket for most of your healthcare.

You can get really cheap private health insurance. You have low monthly payments, but you pay more when you get healthcare. Usually, there is a high [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung), and you get a yearly discount if you don't use your health insurance.[^17]

If you are young and healthy, you could pay just 175€ per month for private insurance (350€ if you are self-employed).[^62] Some insurers also have discounts for students.

You can also pay more and get the best coverage. You have higher monthly payments, but there is no deductible.

**[Quick price estimation ➞](/out/feather-private-estimate)**

Your employer pays half of your health insurance. If you are self-employed, you pay the full price yourself.[^18]

### Benefits of private health insurance

- **Faster doctor appointments**  
    You can get an appointment in days instead of weeks. Try it yourself: go on [Doctolib](https://www.doctolib.de/), and look for the earliest doctor appointment. Try again with private health insurance. It's really hard to find a psychiatrist, a gynaecologist or a paediatrician with public health insurance. It's much easier with private health insurance.
- **You choose your coverage**  
    Your insurance can cover dental care, travel insurance, special treatments etc. You can pay more for the best coverage. You can also choose lower coverage and a high deductible to pay less.[^17] 
- **You pay less when you don't use it**  
    Many private health insurers have a no-claims bonus. If you don't use your health insurance, you get money back every year. If you never get sick, you can save a lot of money.

### Disadvantages of private health insurance

- **You pay more when you use it**  
    With private health insurance, if you don't go to the doctor, you save money. Deductibles and no-claims bonuses discourage you from seeing a doctor.
- **It's more paperwork**  
    With private health insurance, you pay the doctor, get an invoice, and ask your insurer to reimburse you. If you have a deductible (*[[Selbstbeteiligung]]*), you wait until you have enough expenses before you declare them.
- **It's cheap when you are young**  
    If you are young and healthy, you could pay just 175€ per month for private insurance (350€ if you are self-employed). Public health insurance can cost up to {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month for employees ({{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ if you are self-employed). If you are young, healthy and well-paid, private insurance can be much cheaper.
- **It can get expensive when you are old**  
    When you retire, you have a lower income, but your insurance does not get cheaper. After 55 years old, it's almost impossible to go back to public health insurance. You can be stuck with a very expensive health insurance. If you join the private system when you are young, your insurer saves a part of your payments for later, so your insurance won't be too expensive when you are old.
- **Private is expensive if you have pre-existing health problems**  
    Private health insurance often requires a health test before you join. If you have serious pre-existing health problems, they usually reject you. If they accept you, they can charge a lot more.[^14] For example, if you have a chronic disease, get psychotherapy, or need expensive medication, they will reject you. After you are accepted, the price does not change if you get sick.

With private health insurance, there is no long-term care insurance (*Pflegeversicherung*) surcharge. It's included in the price of your insurance.

### Who can have private health insurance?

[If you are voluntarily insured](/guides/german-health-insurance#your-options) (*[[freiwillig versichert]]*), you can choose private or public health insurance. If you are compulsorily insured (*[[Pflichtversichert]]*), you must choose public health insurance.

- **If you are self-employed**, you can choose private insurance. There is no minimum income. If you are a non-EU freelancer, and you just moved to Germany, private health insurance might be your only option, because public health insurers often reject freelancers who are not already on the public system. If you have a low income, private health insurers might reject you, and you might be forced to use [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).
- **If you are an employee, and you earn more than {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year** (before taxes), you can choose public or private health insurance. Your employer will pay half of your insurance.
- **If you are an employee, and you earn less than {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year** (before taxes), you can't choose private health insurance. You must choose public health insurance.
- **If you are a student, a doctor or a civil servant**, you can choose private health insurance. If you are a student 30 years old or older, private health insurance can be cheaper than public health insurance. Private health insurers offer special rates for older students.

Even if you *can* have private health insurance, private health insurers can reject you. For example, if you have serious health problems, they will reject you. If you had psychotherapy, they usually reject you. If you have problems like AIDS, severe asthma, diabetes or obesity, they could also reject you, or charge a lot more.

### What is covered

Private health insurance covers the same things as public health insurance, and often more. **Necessary healthcare is always covered.**

The covered amount is unlimited.[^60] For example, if you get cancer, the treatment can cost millions of euros. Your insurance pays for everything.

With private health insurance, you can choose how much coverage you want. For example, it can cover extra services like dental care, [eyeglasses](/guides/eyeglasses) and laser eye surgery. You can cover less, but pay less every month.

You have more healthcare options, because you can visit doctors and therapists that don't accept public health insurance. Doctors often give priority to patients with private health insurance.

With private health insurance, you usually pay for healthcare yourself, and get reimbursed by the insurance company. For big, expensive treatments, the insurance company pays the doctor directly. This is different from public health insurance, where you just show your insurance card.

### Which private health insurance should I choose?

There are big differences between private health insurance companies. Each offers very different options. **The best option depends on your situation.**

The best way to choose is to ask a health insurance broker. Their help is free. They get paid by the insurance companies when they bring new customers.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) is popular option with expats, because they offer support in English, but [they are not perfect](/guides/ottonova-review).

[Feather](/out/feather-private) also offers private health insurance. They helped me get private health insurance, and I trust them. They are a health insurance broker, not a health insurer. This means that they sell insurance from different companies. They speak English. Their insurance works for [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) applications.

**[Quick price estimation ➞](/out/feather-private-estimate)**

### How to switch to public health insurance

You can switch from private to public health insurance, but it can be hard. Sometimes, it's impossible, and you are stuck with private health insurance.[^19]

There are a few ways to switch:

- **Get unemployment benefits** (*[[ALG I]]*)  
    If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job) and get [[ALG I]], you are usually forced to get public health insurance.
- **Lower your income**  
    If you are an employee, and your income goes below {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€, you must get public health insurance. This does not work for self-employed people.[^20]
- **Join the [[Künstlersozialkasse]]**  
    If you are self-employed, and you join the *Künstlersozialkasse*, you can get public health insurance. Most of the time, you have no other choice.

If you are over 55 years old, you can't switch to public insurance anymore.[^21] Otherwise, everyone would get cheap private health insurance when they are young, and cheap public health insurance when they are old. The public health insurers would go bankrupt.

## Expat health insurance

[[Expat health insurance]] is a kind of private health insurance. It's a **temporary solution** for people who move to Germany. It has much better coverage than travel insurance.

There are **3 reasons to get expat health insurance**:

- You plan to live in Germany for less than 5 years. It's the cheapest short-term health insurance.
- **or** you are applying for a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) *for the first time*. Expat insurance is easier to get than public or private health insurance. It's a good *temporary* insurance, before you get something better.
- **or** you have no other option, because public and private health insurers rejected you. If you are a freelancer and earn under ~30,000€ per year, it can happen. If you are over 50 years old, it can also happen.
- **and** you are not a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) citizen. EU citizens can rarely get expat health insurance.[^33]

### Compared to public and private health insurance

- **It's not accepted when you renew a residence permit**  
    Expat insurance is rarely accepted when you renew your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), or when you apply for a different residence permit.[^29] You must have real public or private health insurance.
- **It can expire after 5 years**  
    Some expat insurances are only valid for 5 years.[^22] Many freelancers stay on expat insurance for too long. When they need to switch to public or private insurance, no insurer wants to cover them. They can't get health insurance, or the only options are very expensive. If you settle in Germany, switch to real health insurance [as soon as possible](#dont-stay-on-expat-health-insurance).
- **The price goes up faster**  
    The cost of expat insurance rises really quickly.[^22] If your expat insurance does not expire, it can become really expensive when you are old. If you stay in Germany for a long time, public or private health insurance is cheaper.
- **The coverage is not as good**  
    Check-ups and dentist visits are rarely covered.[^26] You usually pay a deductible for basic treatments. Long term treatments (like cancer) are 100% covered, without any deductible.

**[List of expat insurance options ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#expat-health-insurance-options)**

You can get expat health insurance from [Feather](/out/feather-expats), [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats), or any [health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers).

### Compared to travel insurance

- **It covers more**  
    Travel insurance usually covers around 30,000€ of medical fees. Expat insurance has unlimited coverage. If you get very sick with travel insurance, you must end your trip and go home. With expat insurance, you can stay in Germany and recover.[^30]
- **It lasts longer**  
    Expat insurance can be valid for a few years. Travel insurance is only valid for a few months.

### Don't stay on expat health insurance

[[Expat health insurance]] is a temporary option. Switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) as soon as you can. If you wait too long, you can have problems:

> **Example 1:** You are a freelancer, and you have expat insurance for 3 years. You regularly see a psychotherapist. You must [renew your freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa), so you need public or private health insurance. Since you see a therapist, no insurer wants to cover you. You can't find health insurance, so you can't renew your freelance visa.

> **Example 2:** You have expat health insurance. You get cancer. After 5 years, your expat insurance expires, and no insurer wants to cover you.

If your expat insurance stays valid, it gets more and more expensive. In the long term, public and private health insurance are cheaper.[^10]

**If you are a freelancer**, switch to public or private health insurance as soon as possible. It's more expensive, but you don't really have a choice. You can get cheaper health insurance if you [join the Künstlersozialkasse](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse).

**If you are a student**, public health insurance is a little more expensive than expat insurance, but it's *much* better. Switch to public health insurance *maximum* 3 months after you start university. If you wait too long, you will be stuck with expat insurance.

## Other options

**The state** pays for your health insurance if...[^45]

- You get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)
- **or** you get *[[Bürgergeld]]*
- **or** you get *[[Elterngeld]]*

If you are a trainee (*[[Azubi]]*) and you earn less than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month, you get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Your employer pays for it.[^48]

### Insurance from other EU countries

If you come from another EU country, you can use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in Germany. If you get healthcare in Germany, your health insurance in your home country pays for it.

- **If you stay in Germany temporarily**, your EHIC covers you. You do not need extra health insurance in Germany.
- **If you are an Erasmus student from another EU country**, your EHIC covers you.[^23] You can use your EHIC card even if you study in Germany for your entire degree.[^32] You do not need extra German health insurance unless you start working.
- **When you start working in Germany**, your EHIC does not cover you anymore. If you earn more than {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you must get German health insurance.[^24]

If health insurance is cheaper in your home country, using your EHIC is cheaper than getting German health insurance. You can save a lot of money every month with the EHIC.

### Travel insurance

Travel insurance is valid **for visiting Germany**. You need it to get a [[Schengen visa]]. It's rarely valid for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.

It only covers medical emergencies, and treatments that can't wait until you go back home. It does not cover long-term treatments, health check-ups or pre-existing conditions.

You can buy travel insurance online in your home country. [HanseMerkur](/out/hansemerkur-travel)'s travel insurance is valid for a Schengen visa application.

### The Künstlersozialkasse (KSK)

If you are a freelance artist, journalist, publicist or influencer, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK). They pay half of your [health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It's always worth it.

**[How to apply for the KSK ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

## How to decide

Choose public health insurance if...

- Your income varies
- You want something that just works
- You want children
- You can get the student tariff

Choose private health insurance if...

- You want the best possible coverage
- You want the lowest possible price
- You plan to leave Germany in a few years

Choose expat health insurance if...

- You need temporary insurance to apply for a residence permit
- You have no other choice

Choose travel insurance if...

- You are just visiting Germany

### Insurance brokers

Health insurance brokers help you choose health insurance. They help you for free. They get paid by health insurers to bring them new customers.

Always work with a broker (*Makler*), not an agent (*Vertreter*). Brokers are independent, and recommend health insurance from different companies. Agents only sell insurance from specific companies.

For example, Feather is an agent, and they mostly sell insurance from Hallesche.[^61] They are a great company and I trust them, but their recommendations are not neutral.

If you are an immigrant, choose a broker who works with expats. Your needs are different, and your broker must know how to help you.

## What to do next

- [ ] [Get liability insurance](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung). It's the second most important insurance to have. Most Germans have it.
- [ ] [Register as an organ donor](/guides/organ-donor). It's really easy, and it can save another person's life.

There are more types of insurance in Germany, but health and liability insurance are the most important.
