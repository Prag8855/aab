When you [move to Germany](/guides/moving-to-berlin), you must choose your health insurance. All German residents need health insurance. It pays for your healthcare when you are sick. You need it to apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and to [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).

This guide explains how German health insurance works, and how to choose the best health insurance for your needs.

## How to get health insurance

1. **Understand [your options](#your-options)**  
    Use my [recommendation tool](#your-options) or keep reading. There are two insurance systems and hundreds of options. The best option depends on your situation.
2. **[Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    Don't choose insurance yourself; it can be an expensive mistake. Get free help from a health insurance broker.
3. **Apply for health insurance**  
    The process is different with each insurer. If you are new in Germany and you choose private health insurance, you usually need a health check from a doctor.[^44] It costs around 250€.[^30]{{ fail_on('2026-06-01') }} In some cases, health insurers can reject you.
4. **Get your documents**  
    After you get insured, you get a health insurance card and a few other things, a *[[Mitgliedsbescheinigung]]* and a *[[Sozialversicherungsnummer]]*. You might need them to [start a new job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working) or [apply for a residence permit](/guides/residence-permit).
5. **Pay every month**  
    If you have public health insurance, you pay out of your paycheck every month. If you have private health insurance or you are self-employed, you pay by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung) or [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).[^35]

## Your options

### Health insurance for employees

Your health insurance is not tied to your job. Your employer does not decide what health insurance you can have. If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), you keep your health insurance.

**If you earn over {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can choose [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).[^3] Public health insurance costs [around {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag).[^1] Private health insurance might be cheaper.[^56]

**If you earn {{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ to {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can only choose [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^3] It costs [around {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag).

**If you earn less than {{GKV_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per year**, you can only choose public health insurance. It costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*).

**If you have a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob)**, you can choose public or private health insurance. You can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. Your employer does not help you pay for health insurance.[^36]

**If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job)**, you can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month.

If you move from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country, your health insurance from your previous country usually covers you until you start working.[^57] It might be much cheaper than German health insurance.

If you move from a non-EU country, you might need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^42] It covers you until you start working. When you start working, you must switch to public or private health insurance. A [health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers) can arrange this for you.

Your employer can help you get health insurance. This is a bad idea. They choose what is easy for them, not what is best for you.[^7]

### Health insurance for students

**If you are under 25 years old**, you can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, you pay the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month. Public health insurance is usually the best option for students.[^59] You can also get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), but it's usually a little more expensive.

**If you are under 30 years old**, you pay the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month. Public health insurance is usually the best option for students.[^59] You also can get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), but it's usually a little more expensive.

**If you are over 30 years old**, you can't get the student tariff. [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) costs around [{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag).[^25] [Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) might be cheaper for you. You can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).

**If you are a foreign student**, you might need temporary health insurance before school starts. If you are from the EU, you can use [health insurance from your home country](#insurance-from-other-eu-countries). If you are not from the EU, you usually need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance).[^47] There are expat insurance plans for students.

**If you are self-employed**, and your income is over {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you are treated [like a self-employed person](#health-insurance-for-freelancers). You can't get the student tariff and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). If you are young and healthy, [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) usually makes the most sense.[^58]

**If you work over 20 hours per week**, you are treated [like a normal employee](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^46] You can't get the student tariff, and you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). There are different rules for [internships](#health-insurance-for-an-internship) and [apprenticeships](#health-insurance-for-an-apprenticeship).

[Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. They can help you find the cheapest health insurance. Their help is free.

### Health insurance for unemployed people

**If you get [[ALG I]], [[Bürgergeld]] or [[Elterngeld]]**, health insurance is free. The state pays for it.[^11] If you had private health insurance, you must usually switch to public health insurance.[^41]

**If you don't get ALG I, Bürgergeld or Elterngeld**, you can choose public or private health insurance. You can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Otherwise, if you have public health insurance, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month.[^40] The cost of private health insurance is not related to your income.

### Health insurance for freelancers

If you are self-employed, you can choose public or private health insurance.[^4]

**[Public health insurance](#public-health-insurance)** costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The minimum cost is around [{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) per month. The maximum cost is around [{{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) per month. You can't get the student tariff, you can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance), and you can't use [health insurance from another EU country](#insurance-from-other-eu-countries).[^37]

**[Private health insurance](#private-health-insurance)** is usually cheaper. The cost is based on your age and your health when you sign up, and the level of coverage you choose.[^79] If you have an unstable income, or you earn less than 30,000€ per year, don't get private health insurance.[^27] Insurers often reject people with a low or unstable income.[^55]

**[Expat health insurance](#expat-health-insurance)** is the cheapest option. This is supposed to be temporary health insurance. You can use it to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa). Staying on expat insurance is a really bad idea. Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you can.

Don't choose health insurance yourself. It's a *really* bad idea when you are self-employed. The best option depends on your citizenship, your income, your health, and your plans for the future. [Ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

If you just moved to Germany, public health insurance might reject you. Private health insurance might be your only option.[^71]

If you are a freelance artist, journalist, publicist or influencer, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It's always worth it. If you earn less than {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year, you must switch to public health insurance.

**[How to apply for the KSK ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

### Health insurance for an apprenticeship

**If you earn less than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**, you get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Your employer pays for it.[^48]

**If you earn more than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**, you can only choose [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^54] It costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*).[^52] You can't get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).[^53]

### Health insurance for an internship

If it's a **mandatory internship during your studies**, you keep your student insurance. Your employer does not pay half of it.[^50]

If it's a **mandatory internship before or after your studies**:[^65]

- **If it's unpaid**  
    You have [the same options as other students](#health-insurance-for-students).[^64]
- **It it pays up to {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**  
    Your health insurance is free. Your employer pays for it.[^49]
- **If it pays more than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month**  
    You have [the same options as other employees](#health-insurance-for-employees).

If it's a **voluntary internship**:[^66]

- **If it's unpaid**  
    You have the [same options as an unemployed student](#health-insurance-for-unemployed-people).[^68] You can get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance).
- **If it pays up to {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    You get free [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). Your employer pays for it.[^69]
- **If it pays more than {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}} per month**  
    You have the [same options as other employees](#health-insurance-for-employees).[^67]

## Public health insurance

89% of Germans have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^2] It's often your only option.

Public health insurance is run by [non-profit insurance funds](/glossary/Krankenkasse), not by the state. The cost and coverage are almost the same for all public health insurers.

### Cost of public health insurance

Public health insurance costs {{GKV_BASE_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income, plus around {{GKV_AVG_ZUSATZBEITRAG}}% for the [insurer surcharge](/glossary/Zusatzbeitrag), and {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MIN_RATE}}% to {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_MAX_RATE}}% for [long-term care insurance](/glossary/Pflegeversicherung). If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

**If you are an employee**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_EMPLOYEE}}% of your income (including *[[Pflegeversicherung]]*). The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MIN_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MAX_COST_EMPLOYEE|cur}}€ per month. Health insurance payments are taken from your paycheck each month.

**If you are unemployed**, you pay the [minimum amount](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag): around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. When you lose your job, you sometimes get [one month of free health insurance](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance).

**If you are a student**, you usually pay the student tariff: {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month. If you are over 30 years old, you can't get the student tariff, so you pay the same price as everyone else.

**If you are an apprentice** (*[[Azubi]]*) and you earn {{GKV_AZUBI_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per month or less, you get free public health insurance. Your employer pays for it.[^48]

**If you are self-employed**, you pay {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY}}% of your income. The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. The [maximum cost](/glossary/Höchstbeitrag) is around {{GKV_MAX_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}}€ per month. You pay for health insurance by [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) every month.[^8]

### Free health insurance

- Your parents have public health insurance
- and you are under 23 years old (under 25 years old if you are a student)

- and you are not self-employed full time
- and you are not an apprentice (*[[Azubi]]*)[^53]

- and you are not self-employed full time
- and you are not a apprentice (*[[Azubi]]*)[^53]

Your health insurance from another EU country covers you if...[^39]

- Your total income is under {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month ({{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month for a [minijob](/glossary/Minijob))
- or you are a student, and you work 20 hours per week or less[^38]

Your employer pays for your health insurance if...[^48]

- You are an apprentice (*[[Azubi]]*)

The state pays for your health insurance if...[^45]

- You get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)
- or you get *[[Bürgergeld]]*
- or you get *[[Elterngeld]]*

When you lose your job, you sometimes get [one month of free health insurance](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance).

If you are a [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) citizen, you can sometimes use your [insurance from your home country](#insurance-from-other-eu-countries). This is great if you get free health insurance in your home country.

### What public insurance covers

Public health insurance covers **all necessary healthcare**. Important treatments and medical prescriptions are always covered. There is a small deductible for some prescriptions: 5€ to 10€ per prescription.[^70] There is no other deductible. There is no coverage limit.

When you go to the doctor, you give your insurance card, and they charge your *[[Krankenkasse]]* directly. If a treatment is not covered, you know before you start. There are no surprise costs.

Public health insurance covers essential dental care, like removing your wisdom teeth. You also get 2 free dental check-ups every year. It does not cover tooth cleanings. You can get [dental insurance](/glossary/Zahnzusatzversicherung) to get better coverage.

Glasses and contact lenses [are rarely covered](/guides/eyeglasses). You must pay for them yourself.

Public health insurance also covers your children and your unemployed spouse for free. This is called *[[Familienversicherung]]*.

### Benefits of public health insurance

- **The cost is proportional to your income**  
    If you have a low income, you pay less. This is great if you have an unstable income, if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), or if you retire. If you just [started your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or your income is low, choose public health insurance.[^27]
- **It's cheap for students**  
    Students pay around {{GKV_COST_STUDENT|cur}}€ per month until they are 30 years old. Usually, public is the best option for students.[^59]
- **It covers your family for free**  
    Your children and your unemployed spouse get [free health insurance](#free-health-insurance). Private health insurance charges for each person you cover. If you have more than 2 children, public health insurance is usually cheaper.[^12]
- **It's easy to use**  
    When you go to the doctor, you show your insurance card, and you get healthcare. You never need to think about coverage, deductibles or reimbursement. There is no paperwork; it just works.
- **It's not tied to your health**  
    The price is based on your income. You don't pay more if you have serious health conditions, or if you use your health insurance all the time.

### Disadvantages of public health insurance

- **It's expensive if you have a high income**  
    If you have a high income, you pay more. If you are young and healthy when you join, private health insurance can be better *and* cheaper.[^63]
- **It's harder to get doctor appointments**[^13]  
    It's hard to find a psychotherapist, psychiatrist, gynaecologist, paediatrician or urologist. Those who accept public health insurance are booked for weeks or months. If you want to see a doctor quickly, private health insurance is much better.
- **It does not cover special treatments**  
    Public health insurance covers *necessary* care. If you want fancier treatments, you must pay for the price difference. For example, it only covers amalgam tooth fillings, not fancy composite fillings. It only covers basic teeth cleanings, twice per year. Eyeglasses are rarely covered. With private health insurance, you can choose better coverage.

### Best public health insurance

[Public health insurers](/glossary/Krankenkasse) have almost the same cost and coverage. The price difference is less than 20€ per month after taxes. The biggest difference is customer service.[^15]

If you need an English-speaking public health insurer, choose [Barmer](/out/barmer) or [Techniker Krankenkasse](/out/feather-tk). Currently, Barmer has the best English-language support and service. Techniker Krankenkasse is also [very good](/guides/techniker-krankenkasse-review), and slightly cheaper.{{ fail_on('2025-12-31') }}

The most important question is public or private health insurance.[^51] [Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you decide. The can help you get a cheaper health insurance *and* better coverage.

## Private health insurance

11% of Germans have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).[^16] You can get private health insurance if...

- You are and employee and you earn over {{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year[^3]
- or you are self-employed
- or you are a student
- or you are a civil servant (*Beamter*)[^31]

Everyone else must get [public health insurance](#public-health-insurance).

### Cost of private health insurance

Your employer pays half of your health insurance. If you are self-employed, you pay the full price yourself.[^18] You pay for health insurance by [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) every month.[^8]

The cost depends on 4 things:

- **Your age when you join**  
    Young people pay less. The insurer saves a part of your payments for old age. If you join when you are young, you pay less when you are old. If you plan to leave Germany after a few years, you can get health insurance without old age provisions. It's much cheaper. If you are over 45 years old, public health insurance usually makes more sense.[^28]
- **Your health condition when you join**  
    If you have no health insurance history, you must get a health check at the doctor.[^44] If you have pre-existing health problems, insurers charge more or reject you.[^9] After you join, if you get really sick and use your insurance all the time, the price does not change, and they can't kick you out.
- **The coverage you choose**  
    You can get the best coverage or the lowest price. To cover your spouse and children, you must pay more.
- **Your [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung)**  
    A high deductible means lower monthly payments, but it also means paying out of pocket for most of your healthcare.

**[Quick price estimation ➞](/out/feather-private-estimate)**

You can get really cheap private health insurance. You have low monthly payments, but you pay more when you get healthcare. Usually, there is a high [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung), and you get a yearly discount if you don't use your health insurance.[^17]

You can also pay more and get the best coverage. You have higher monthly payments, but there is no deductible.

A young, healthy employee could pay just 250€ per month for private insurance.[^62] Some insurers also have discounts for students.

### Benefits of private health insurance

- **Cheaper than public for high earners**[^19]  
    If you have a high income, private is usually cheaper than public. You can also pay a similar price, but get better coverage.
- **Faster doctor appointments**  
    You can get an appointment in days instead of weeks. Try it yourself: go on [Doctolib](https://www.doctolib.de/), and look for the earliest doctor appointment. Try again with private health insurance. It's really hard to find a psychiatrist, a gynaecologist or a paediatrician with public health insurance. It's much easier with private health insurance.
- **You choose your coverage**  
    Your insurance can cover dental care, travel insurance, special medication and special treatments. You can pay more every month for the best coverage. If you choose lower coverage and a high deductible, you pay less every month.[^17]
- **You pay less when you don't use it**  
    Many private health insurers have a no-claims bonus. If you don't use your health insurance, you get money back every year. If you never get sick, you can save a lot of money.

### Disadvantages of private health insurance

- **It discourages getting healthcare**  
    You usually have a yearly [deductible](/glossary/Selbstbeteiligung). You pay for healthcare yourself until you reach that deductible. After that, the insurer pays for your healthcare. If you are below the deductible, you might ignore small health problems instead of paying 50€ to 150€ to see a doctor.
- **You pay, then you get reimbursed**  
    When you go to the doctor, you pay for it, and your health insurance reimburses you later. This is more effort and more paperwork. You also need enough money to pay for your medical bills, even if you get reimbursed later.
- **It does not adjust to your income**  
    If your income changes, your health insurance costs the same. For example, if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), your business fails or you retire, your health insurance does not get cheaper. Public health insurance is a much safer option, because the cost is proportional to your income.
- **They can reject you**  
    If you have serious health problems, they can reject you. If you had psychotherapy, they usually reject you. If you have problems like HIV, severe asthma, diabetes or obesity, they usually reject you, or sometimes charge a lot more. They can also refuse to cover healthcare related to a pre-existing health problem.[^75] If you have pre-existing health problems, public health insurance might be your only option.[^6]
- **You can be stuck with private**  
    It's hard to switch from private to public health insurance. If you are over 55 years old, it's almost impossible. You can be stuck with a private insurance you can't afford, with no way to switch to public. You can sometimes switch to a cheaper private health insurance.[^72]

### What private insurance covers

The coverage depends on the plan you choose. **Necessary healthcare is always covered.** The coverage is usually equal or better to public health insurance.

The overall coverage is unlimited. There is no yearly limit. If you get cancer and the treatment costs millions of euros, your insurance pays for everything. Some treatments might have deductibles or yearly limits. For example, some plans have coverage limits for psychotherapy.[^60] A [broker](#insurance-brokers) can help you choose a plan that fits your needs.

You can customize your coverage. For example, your insurance can cover extra services like dental care, [eyeglasses](/guides/eyeglasses) and laser eye surgery. It can cover better dental implants, a better wheelchair, or a better hospital room. You can also get lower coverage to pay less every month.

You have more healthcare options, because you can visit doctors and therapists that don't accept public health insurance. Doctors often give priority to patients with private health insurance.

With private health insurance, you usually pay for healthcare yourself, and get reimbursed by the insurance company. For big, expensive treatments, the insurance company pays the doctor directly. This is different from public health insurance, where you just show your insurance card.

### Best private health insurance

There are thousands of private health insurance options. There are huge differences between options. **The best option depends on your situation.**

Do not choose private health insurance yourself. It's a really bad idea. The best way to choose is to [ask a health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers). Their help is free.

[Feather](/out/feather-private) sells private health insurance. They are excellent, but they only sell insurance from a few companies. They might not sell the best insurance for your needs. To compare all insurance options, [talk to a broker](#insurance-brokers).

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) sells their own private health insurance. It's rarely the best option.[^77] Don't choose Ottonova directly. [Ask a broker](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. If Ottonova is a good option for you, they will tell you.[^76]

## Other options

### Expat health insurance

[[Expat health insurance]] is a temporary health insurance. It covers medical emergencies before you can get public or private health insurance. You can *sometimes* use it to apply for your first visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^5] You can't use it to change or renew an existing residence permit.[^29]

**If you are an employee**, you might need expat insurance to apply for an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte). You must switch to public or private health insurance when you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working).

**If you are a freelancer**, use expat insurance to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).[^6] Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you get your residence permit. If you wait too long, you can be stuck with expat insurance. This is a really bad idea.

**If you are a student**, public health insurance is a little more expensive than expat insurance, but it's *much* better. Switch to public health insurance *maximum* 3 months after you start university.[^14] If you wait too long, you can be stuck with expat insurance. This is a really bad idea.

**[Health insurance for a residence permit ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**

Don't stay on expat health insurance. It's a really bad idea. Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as possible. The coverage is bad and the price raises quickly.[^26] It usually expires after 5 years.[^22]

If you develop a health condition while you have expat insurance, it can be really hard to find long-term health insurance, because all insurers will refuse to cover you. You can end up with a really expensive health insurance.

If you want to stay in Germany for a long time, don't stay on expat insurance. It's a bad idea because...

- **The price goes up faster**  
    The cost of expat insurance rises really quickly.[^22] If your expat insurance stays valid, it gets more and more expensive. In the long term, public and private health insurance are cheaper.[^10]
- **The coverage is not as good**  
    Check-ups and dentist visits are rarely covered.[^26] You usually pay a deductible for basic treatments. Long term treatments (like cancer) are 100% covered, without any deductible.

Get expat health insurance from a [health insurance broker](#insurance-brokers). [Feather](/out/feather-expats) and [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats) also sell expat insurance.

**[List of expat insurance options ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#expat-health-insurance-options)**

### Travel insurance

Travel insurance is valid **for visiting Germany**. You need it to get a [[Schengen visa]]. It's rarely valid for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.

It only covers medical emergencies, and treatments that can't wait until you go back home. It does not cover long-term treatments, health check-ups or pre-existing conditions.

You can buy travel insurance online in your home country. [HanseMerkur](/out/hansemerkur-travel)'s travel insurance is valid for a Schengen visa application.

**[Health insurance for a Schengen visa ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-schengen-visa)**

### Insurance from other EU countries

If you come from another EU country, you can use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in Germany. If you get healthcare in Germany, your health insurance in your home country pays for it.

- **If you stay in Germany temporarily**, your EHIC covers you. You do not need extra health insurance in Germany.
- **If you are an Erasmus student from another EU country**, your EHIC covers you.[^23] You can use your EHIC card even if you study in Germany for your entire degree.[^32] You do not need extra German health insurance unless you start working.
- **When you start working in Germany**, your EHIC does not cover you anymore. If you earn more than {{MINIJOB_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you must get German health insurance.[^24]

If health insurance is cheaper in your home country, using your EHIC is cheaper than getting German health insurance. You can save a lot of money every month with the EHIC.

## How to choose

There is no reason to choose your insurance yourself. [Ask an expert](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose.

### Choose public health insurance if...

- **You don't have a stable income**  
    If you are not sure you will always have a high income, public health insurance is safer. It costs a percentage of your income, so if you make less, your pay less. If you just [started your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or your income is low, choose public health insurance.[^27]
- **You want something that just works**  
    Just show your card and get healthcare. It takes longer to get an appointment, but you don't have to deal with any paperwork.
- **You want more than 2 children**  
    Public health insurance covers your children [for free](/glossary/Familienversicherung). Private health insurance charges extra for each child. If both parents have a high income, private health insurance can be cheaper anyway.[^12]
- **You pay the student tariff**  
    The student tariff is a really good deal. If you are a student under 30 years old, public health insurance is usually the best option.[^59]

### Choose private health insurance if...

- **You have stable income**  
    Private health insurance makes sense if you have a high income for the rest of your career.
- **You want fast doctor appointments**  
    It's much easier to find a doctor.
- **You want the best coverage**  
    Private health insurance lets you pay more and get the best coverage for you and your family.
- **You want better treatment**  
    You can choose a specific doctor, or a specific kind of treatment. For example, you can get innovative therapy or medication that is not yet covered by public health insurance.[^73] It can cover better dental implants, a better wheelchair, or a better hospital room.
- **You plan to leave Germany in a few years**  
    You can get short-term private health insurance. It's up to 50% cheaper, because there is no old age provision.[^74]

### Choose expat health insurance if...

- **You apply for an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)**  
    Expat health insurance is ideal for this. When you [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), switch to public or private health insurance.
- **You have no other choice**  
    Expat health insurance is the cheapest option. It's a bad long-term solution, but it might be the only health insurance you can afford.

German embassies and consulates *sometimes* accept expat health insurance for a visa application.[^33] Get public or private health insurance instead if you can.

The [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde) *sometimes* accepts expat health insurance for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application. It sometimes works when it's your first residence permit. It does not work when you change or renew your residence permit.[^21]

**[Health insurance for a visa application ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**

### Choose travel insurance if...

- **You are a tourist**  
    Travel insurance covers medical emergencies while you travel. It's very cheap.
- **You apply for a [[Schengen visa]]**  
    You need valid health insurance to apply for the Schengen visa. [HanseMerkur's Visa Plus travel insurance](/out/hansemerkur-travel) works well for this.

**[Health insurance for a Schengen visa ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-schengen-visa)**

### Insurance brokers

Brokers help you choose health insurance. They help you for free. They get paid by health insurers to bring them new customers. I strongly recommend you to ask a broker to help you choose health insurance.

Always work with a broker (*Makler*), not an agent (*Vertreter*). Brokers are independent. They recommend health insurance from different companies. Agents only sell insurance from specific companies.

If you are an immigrant, choose a broker who works with expats. Your needs are different, and your broker must know how to help you.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

[Feather](/out/feather) is an agent, not a broker. They mostly sell insurance from Hallesche.[^61] [Ottonova](/out/ottonova) sells their own insurance. Even if you get Ottonova, it's better to get it through a broker.

## What to do next

### Get your documents

Once you are insured, you get...

- **A [[Mitgliedsbescheinigung]]**  
    It's a proof of health insurance. Use it to apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).
- **A health insurance card**  
    If you have public health insurance, show it to your doctor when you need healthcare. It's a proof of health insurance.
- **A [[Sozialversicherungsnummer]]**  
    When you [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working), your employer needs this number as soon as possible. If you get private health insurance, you do not get a *Sozialversicherungsnummer* automatically. Your employer can also request it for you.[^80] You can also [contact the *Deutsche Rentenversicherung*](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/DRV/DE/Beratung-und-Kontakt/Kontakt/Anschriften-Uebersicht/anschriften_uebersicht_detail.html) and ask for it.

### Get liability insurance

You should also get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung). It's the second most important insurance to have. Most Germans have it. There are [many types of insurance](/guides/insurance), but health and liability insurance are the most important.

I got my liability insurance from [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht). If you [ask a broker](#insurance-brokers) to help you choose health insurance, they can also help you find liability insurance.

**[How to choose liability insurance ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

### Get travel insurance

Travel insurance covers medical emergencies when you travel to other countries. It usually costs less than 20€ per year.[^78]

Your private health insurance usually includes travel insurance, but you should get separate travel insurance anyway. If you see a doctor abroad, you don't lose your no-claims bonus.[^20]

Public health insurance rarely includes travel insurance.

You can get travel insurance from [Envivas](https://www.envivas.de/en/insurance/travelling-abroad) or Allianz. I have used both, and they worked when I needed them. Envivas paid for helicopter transport and a hospital stay when my friend got sick in the mountains.

### Other kinds of insurance

Read about the other [types of insurance in Germany](/guides/insurance). The next most important insurances to have are [legal insurance](/glossary/Rechtsschutzversicherung) and [disability insurance](/glossary/Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung).

**[Types of insurance in Germany ➞](/guides/insurance)**

### Become an organ donor

If you are new in Germany, [register as an organ donor](/guides/organ-donor). It's really easy, and it can save another person's life.
