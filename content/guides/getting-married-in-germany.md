## How hard is it?

**It's a bureaucratic nightmare.** It takes 2 to 10 months.[^3] It costs a few hundred euros. People often [get married in Denmark](#get-married-in-denmark) because it's cheaper, faster and easier.

You must prepare a lot of documents. If you are an immigrant, you need a lot of original documents from your home country. They must be certified by both countries, then translated by a certified translator. It's expensive.

## How much does it cost?

**A few hundred euros.** It costs more if you were born in another country or if you don't speak German. You need certified translations for everything, and they are expensive.[^7] If you don't speak German, you also need a sworn interpreter.

## How to get married

This is how you register your marriage and become officially married. It's called the *Eheschließung*. Your names are added to the *Eheregister*.

### 1. Prepare the required documents

You need these documents to get married.[^2] Your city might require more documents.

For each person, you need...

- [ ] **Passport**
- [ ] **Official copy of your birth certificate**  
    It must be less than 6 months old.[^4] If it's not a EU birth certificate, it needs an *Apostille* and [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung).
- [ ] **Registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)  
    You might need a [recent copy](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung) of it (*[[Meldebescheinigung]]*) that is less than 3 weeks old.
- [ ] **Income certificate** (*Einkommensbescheinigung*)  
    If you have a work contract, your employer's HR department should provide you with a copy. If you’re a freelancer, download [this form](http://www.dautphetal.de/media/custom/2224_71_1.PDF?1366885698) (here's [a copy](/images/2224_71_1.pdf)) and [ask an accountant](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin) to review/sign it for you.
- [ ] **Certificate of no impediment to marriage** (*Ehefähigkeitszeugnis*)  
    You can usually get it from your embassy. To get this document, you might need to send more documents. It can take a few weeks. Some countries don't to give a valid *Ehefähigkeitszeugnis*. Your certificate might need to be approved by a *Kammergericht* for around 75€.
- [ ] **Divorce certificate**  
    If you were married before, you need it to prove your divorce. If it's not a EU birth certificate, it needs an *Apostille* and [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung).

If your name, gender or nationality changed, you might need certificates to prove it:

- [ ] **Naturalisation certificate** (*Einbürgerungsurkunde*)  
    If you became a German citizen, bring this document.
- [ ] **Name change certificate** (*Namensänderungsurkunde*)  
    If you changed your name, bring this document.

**All your documents must be in German.**[^9] If your original documents are in a different alphabet, make sure that your names are always translated the same way.

They might ask for **documents that don't exist** or that are impossible to get. You must convince them that you can't get those documents. Your only option might be to get married in another EU country.

Sometimes, **your documents might expire** while you wait. Your application might be rejected, and you might need to get a newer version of the documents.[^5]

### 2. Get a Standesamt appointment

Get an appointment at the *Bürgeramt* or *Standesamt*, depending on your city. In some cities, appointments can be hard to find. They can be months later.

In Berlin, some *Standesamt* locations have no appointments. You must contact them and ask for instructions.

### 3. Find an interpreter

If you don't speak German, you must bring a sworn interpreter to the *Standesamt* appointment.[^6] You can't just bring a friend who speaks German. In Berlin, I recommend [Red Tape Translation](https://allaboutberlin.com/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter).

### 4. Go to your appointment

Both spouses must go to the appointment. Bring all the [required documents](#prepare-the-required-documents). If you don't speak German, bring a sworn interpreter.

### 5. Get approved

2 to 4 weeks after your *Standesamt* appointment, you get a certificate that confirms that you can get married. In Berlin, you have 6 months to get married after you get that certificate.

## Get married in Denmark

People often **get married in Denmark**. It's cheaper, faster and *much* easier than getting married in Germany.[^1] You can book everything online, and go to Denmark to get married a few weeks later. You need fewer documents, *Apostille* and certified translations, so it's cheaper.

After your get married in another country, you must register your marriage in Germany (*Nachbeurkundung*). If you got married in the EU, it's easy.
