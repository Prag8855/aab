In this guide, we show you how to plan your retirement in Germany. I wrote this guide for people who don't speak German, and don't understand finance. I will explain slowly, and give many examples.

This is not a sponsored guide. I have done my own research, and I have talked with many experts.

## Important concepts

Before you read this guide, you must understand a few things. This is important. If you don't understand these things, you can waste a lot of money.

### What is a pension?

A pension allows you to save money for retirement. You put money in your pension while you work. When you stop working, you receive money from your pension every month.

### Compound interest

Compound interest means that your investments grow faster every year. Here's how it works.

Let's say you invest 1000€, and your investment grows by 10% every year.

1. The first year, you start with 1000€. You earn 100€ (10% of 1000€). At the end of the year, you have 1100€.
2. The second year, you start with 1100€. You earn 110€ (10% of 1100€). At the end of the year, you have 1210€.
3. The third year, you start 1210€. You earn 121€ (10% of 1210€). At the end of the year, you have 1331€.
4. The fourth year, you have 1331€. You earn 133€ (10% of 1331€).
5. After 50 years, you will have have 117 391€. You will earn 11 739€ in one year! (10% of 117 391€)

As you can see, every year, your investment grows faster. At first, it only grows 100€ per year, but after 50 years, it grows 11739€ per year. This is because every year, you have more savings. It still grows by 10%, but it's 10% of a bigger amount. [Try it yourself!](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm)

**With compound interest, fees make a huge difference**. If you get a 5% return, but pay 3% in fees, your investment only grows 2% per year.

Let's say you invest 50€ *every month* for 40 years, and that investment grows 5% every year.

- If you pay no fees, your investment grows 5% every year. In 40 years, you will have 72 480€.
- If you pay a 1% fee, your investment grows 4% every year. In 40 years, you will have 57 015€.
- If you pay a 3% fee, your investment grows 2% every year. In 40 years, you will have 36 241€.

As you can see, a 1% fee means you will retire with 20% less. **A 3% fee means you will have 50% less when you retire**. High fees can cost you a lot of money.

### Inflation

Things get a little more expensive each year. This is called inflation. In Europe, inflation is around 2% per year[^3]. This means that every year, you need 2% more money to buy the same things. In 30 years, your 1€ coffee will cost 1.80€.

**If your investment grows slower than inflation, you are getting poorer**. The price of things grows faster than your investment. In other words, inflation is a bit like a 2% fee: it eats some of your returns.

For example, let's say you invest 1€ now, and it grows 1% every year. In 30 years, you will have 1.35€. However, everything else gets 2% more expensive. Your money will grow by 35%, but everything will be 80% more expensive.

When you plan your retirement, you must think about inflation. When you retire, everything will be twice as expensive. A 2000€ per month pension seems great now, but in 40 years, it will barely cover your rent.


### Tax deferral

German pensions are tax-deductible. If you put money in your pension, it's not counted in your income, so you pay less taxes. Your pension is taxed later, when you receive pension payments.

This is called a tax deferral. Tax deferrals allow you to pay less taxes. Here's how.

If you make a lot of money, you pay a larger part of your income in taxes. If you make less money, you pay a smaller percentage[^4].

If you spread your income equally (the same income every year), you will pay less income tax. You also pay less for health insurance and many other things.

For example, if you earned 90 000€ last year, and 10 000€ this year, you would pay 40 546€ + 2003€ in taxes and insurance. You earn 100 000€ in total, and you pay 42 549€ in taxes and insurance.

If you earned 50 000€ last year, and 50 000€ this year, you would pay 19 942€ + 19 942€ in taxes. You earned 100 000€ in total, and paid 39 884€ in taxes. You earned the same amount, but you paid 2665€ less taxes.

A pension can help you do that. With a pension, you earn less now (because you put money in your pension), and more later (because you receive a pension). When you are old, you won't have a big income, so you will pay less taxes.

This is called a tax deferral.

## The public pension system


The public pension scheme (*gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung*) is a pension all German employees are part of. If you work in Germany, a part of your paycheque goes to the public pension.

Self-employed people *can* join the public pension system, but they don't have to.

## Riester pensions

The *Riester-Rente* is a type of voluntary private pension.

Riester pensions are not available to self-employed people[^0].

### Benefits of a Riester pension

- You can withdraw up to 30% of your pension as a lump sum when you retire[^1].
- The employer often contributes to your pension[^5].

Disadvantages of a Riester pension

## Rürup pensions

The *Rürup-Rente* or *Basisrente* is a type of voluntary private pension[^6].

Here's how they work:

1. During the **savings phase** (*Ansparphase*), you put aside a the same amount every month. Those contributions are 90% tax-deductible[^2]. You can't touch your money during the savings phase.
2. During the **payment phase** (*Rentenphase*), you receive a fixed amount of money every month[^5]. You pay income tax on the pension payments. The payment phase starts when you are 67 years old, and it ends when you die. You can start earlier, at 62 years old, but you will receive less money each month. You can't withdraw the money all at once.

For example, you save 500€ a month from 27 to 67 years old (the *Ansparphase*). Then you receive 2000€ a month from 67 years old until you die (the *Rentenphase*). These are just example numbers.

Some pension plans manage the money for you. Others let you choose how it's invested. Some funds offer a guaranteed return, and others don't. In general, more management and more guarantees means higher fees.

### Benefits of a Rürup pension

- Pension contributions are tax-deductible. A Rürup pension is a good way to defer income tax.

### Disadvantages of a Rürup pension

- During the savings phase, you can't touch the money. For example, you can't withdraw the money to buy a house.
- During the payment phase, you get a fixed amount every month[^5]. You can't withdraw the money all at once.
- Some pensions have very high fees. Those fees can eat half of your investment.

Rürup pensions can't be inherited[^7]. If you die during the payments phase, a certain percentage can go to your spouse or children.

Open questions:

- What happens when you die at 45? 70? 95? Where does the money go?
- What if I can't pay the pension (for example due to a disability)? - no unusual benefits
- Projections with fees

## Employer pensions

Betrieblich. Money put into pension is pre-tax

## Completely private pensions

Same as others, with no government benefits, no tax deferral. More control on how it can be withdrawn.

## Why pension plans are worth it

Pension plans are a great way to [defer income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_deferral#Income_tax_deferral).

You can deduct pension contributions from your income. That means you pay less income tax now

You can pay less income tax now while your income is high, and more income tax later when your income is lower.

## Things you need to be careful about

- Inflation
- Fees
- Perverse incentives in the insurance industry
- Not being able to touch the money
- Maximum tax-deductible contributions
- Dieing

For example, if you earn 50000€ a year, and put 10000€ in your pension, you only pay income tax on 40000€. Later, when you receive a pension, you will pay income tax on that pension. Since you will make less money, you will be taxed less.

When invest in your pension, you only pay income tax when you withdraw the money. You pay less income tax now, and more income tax later.
