## Taxes, insurance and pension

**Cost:** use the tax calculator

In Germany, a part of your [gross income (*Brutto*)](/glossary/Brutto%20income) is for taxes and social contribution. Your employer automatically takes them from your salary. The money you keep is your [net income (*Netto*)](/glossary/Netto%20income).

{% include 'blocks/_taxCalculator.html' %}

If you are self-employed, don't pay unemployment insurance, and pension insurance is optional. You might also pay a [trade tax (*Gewerbesteuer*)](/glossary/Gewerbesteuer).

If you make money with stocks and other investments, it's taxed separately. You pay a capital gains tax (*Kapitalertragsteuer*) of 25%[^0]. Cryptocurrencies are taxed [differently](https://taxfix.de/ratgeber/pflichten/bitcoin-und-steuer/#versteuern).

### How to pay less income tax

- Deduct expenses in your tax declaration. It reduces your taxable income, so you pay less income tax. [Tax advisors and tax software](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin) can help you find expenses to deduct.
- Contribute to your retirement pension. Pension contributions are taxed later, when you get a pension. It's a way to defer income tax.

### How to pay less for health insurance

- Learn [how to choose German health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance). Don't just pick the default option. My [health insurance calculator](/tools/health-insurance-calculator) show you what options you have.
- Choose a [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) with a lower *[[Zusatzbeitrag]]*.
- Switch to [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). It's *sometimes* cheaper. This is not a simple decision. [Talk to a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) first.
- Switch to [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It can be much cheaper. In most cases, this is a *really* bad idea, but in some cases, it can make sense. [Talk to a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) first.
- If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher, [join the *Künstlersozialkasse* (*KSK*)](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung). It's a really good deal.

### How to pay less pension insurance

- If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher, [join the *Künstlersozialkasse* (*KSK*)](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung). It's a really good deal.
- If you leave Germany, you can sometimes [get your pension payments back](/guides/pension-payments-refund).

### How to pay less church tax

- [Leave the church](https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/stop-paying-german-church-tax/), and stop paying the church tax.

## Rent

**Cost:** 400€ to 750€ per month (room), 600€ to 1,500€ per month (apartment)

Rent is often your biggest expense. Many immigrants get very expensive furnished apartments, because they can't find anything else. After a few months in Germany, you should look for something cheaper.

In Germany, there is the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*), and the warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*). The warm rent includes heating and hot water (the *[[Nebenkosten]]*).

### How to pay less for rent

- Live in a [[WG]] - share an apartment with other people. You split the rent, the internet, the [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag), and other bills.
- If you are a student, live in a dormitory (*Studentenwohnheim*). [StudierendenWerk housing](https://www.stw.berlin/en/housing.html) is much cheaper than regular apartments.
- [Move to a cheaper area](/guides/saving-money-germany#move-to-a-cheaper-area). In Berlin, apartments are cheaper outside the *[Ring](/glossary/Ringbahn)*, but they are still close to the centre.
- If your rent is over the legal maximum, [get it lowered](/guides/saving-money-germany#lower-your-rent). This is your right. Your landlord can't punish you.

## Food

**Cost:** around 250€ per month

If you only eat at home, you should pay around 250€ per month for groceries. If you eat out, you will spend a lot more.

## Public transit

**Cost (Berlin):** 44€ to 86€ per month (monthly pass), or 3€ per ride

### How to pay less for public transit

- [Get a yearly subscription](/guides/saving-money-germany#get-a-yearly-public-transit-pass). It's much cheaper than a [monthly pass](/glossary/Monatskarte).
- In Berlin, get a [10-Uhr-Karte](/guides/bvg-10-uhr-karte) if you don't use public transportation between 3AM and 10AM on weekdays.
- If you are a university or *Hochschule* student, your get a very cheap *Semesterticket* from your school[^1]. It's usually included in your school fees.

## Electricity

**Cost:** 60€ to 100€ per month

In Germany, the heating and hot water are usually included in your warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*). You still need an electricity contract for the lights and appliances.

**[How electric bills work ➞](/guides/electric-bill-berlin)**

### How to pay less for electricity

- Use a [price comparator](/out/verivox-electricity) to find a cheaper electricity company
- [Change to a new electricity provider every year](/guides/saving-money-germany#change-electricity-and-gas-providers-every-year)

## Internet

**Cost:** around 35€ per month

For 35€ per month, you can get a 100 Mbit/s internet connection.

### How to pay less for internet

- Use a [price comparator](/out/verivox-internet) to find a internet service provider
- When your internet contract is about to expire, call your internet company and ask for a better price. They will renew your contract, but give you a better plan. For example, I got a free upgrade from 100 Mbit/s to 300 Mbit/s.

## Mobile phone

**Cost:** 5€ to 40€ per month

### How to pay less for phone service

- Use a [price comparator](/out/verivox-cellphone) to find a cheaper phone plan.
- Get a prepaid phone plan. A prepaid phone plan with 3 to 5 GB data costs around 10€ per month.
- Buy your own phone. It's cheaper to buy the phone you want, than to get a 2 year mobile phone plan with a new phone.

## TV tax

**Cost:** {{RUNDFUNKBEITRAG_FEE|cur}}€ per household per month

In Germany, every household must pay the [TV tax (*Rundfunkbeitrag*)](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag). If you live with other people, you can split the cost. [In some cases](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag?x-craft-preview=1#can-i-pay-less), you don't have to pay it.

You will receive a TV tax invoice by mail every 3 months. You can pay manually with a [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung), or automatically with a [debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).

**[What is the Rundfunkbeitrag? ➞](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag)**

### How to avoid the TV tax

- If you receive financial aid (*[[ALG II]]* or [*BAföG*](/glossary/BAföG)), you can fill [this form](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/formulare/befreiung_oder_ermaessigung_beantragen/index_ger.html) to stop paying the TV tax.
- If you live with other people, you only need to pay the TV tax once. You can split the cost.

## Banking

**Cost:** 0€ to 10€ per month

Some banks charge a monthly fee. It's usually around 10€ per month. Some banks also charge 5€ to 10€ when you use an ATM from another network.

### How to avoid banking fees

- [Find a bank with low fees](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany).

## Liability insurance

**Cost:** around 5€ per month

[Liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) is optional, but it's a *really* good idea. If you cause an accident, and someone sues you, the liability insurance pays for the damages. It costs around 5€ per month. Most Germans have it.

**[How to choose liability insurance in Germany ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

## Vehicles

**Cost:** at least 100€ per month

Cars are expensive to own and maintain. If you have a car, you must pay for parking, car insurance, vehicle tax, fuel, tires and maintenance.

**[Cost of owning a car in Germany ➞](/guides/car-cost-of-ownership-germany)**

**How to save money:**

- Don't buy a car. In most cities, [you don't need a car](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car). You should [buy a bicycle](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin) and [use public transit](/guides/public-transit).
- Buy a small economy car. They are cheaper to buy, and cheaper to maintain. They use less fuel, and the [vehicle tax](/glossary/Kraftfahrzeugsteuer) is cheaper.
- [Pay less for car insurance](/guides/car-insurance-germany#how-to-pay-less-for-german-car-insurance). There are many ways to do this.

## Dogs

**Cost:** at least 50€ per month

If you have a dog, you must pay for dog food, [liability insurance](/glossary/Hundehaftpflichtversicherung), [health insurance](/glossary/Tierkrankenversicherung), dog food and [dog tax](/glossary/Hundesteuer).

The dog tax is 120€ to 180€ per year. Dog liability insurance is required, and it costs around 5€ per month. Pet health insurance is optional, and it costs around 20€ per month. You can see the price of dog food [here](https://www.fressnapf.de/c/hund/hundefutter/trockenfutter/).

## One time expenses

### Apartment deposit ([[Kaution]])

**Who pays it:** People who rent an apartment

**Cost:** around 3 times your [cold rent (*Kaltmiete*)](/glossary/Kaltmiete)

When you [move into an apartment](/guides/moving-in), you must pay a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). You can't touch that money until you [move out](/guides/moving-out).

If you live in a [[WG]], the deposit is smaller. Sometimes, there is no deposit.

**[How apartment deposits work ➞](/guides/mietkaution)**

### Furniture, appliances, etc

**Cost:** 200€ to 10,000€

When you [move into your first apartment](/guides/moving-in), you must get new furniture, new appliances, kitchen equipment, etc. In Germany, you might even need to buy light fixtures, and a kitchen counter.

To save money, buy used furniture. You can find free/cheap furniture on [eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/) and [various Facebook groups](/guides/how-do-i-buy-and-sell-used-things-in-berlin#facebook-groups).

## Example budget
