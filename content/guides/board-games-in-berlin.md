Want a nice place to play board games with your friends, and perhaps make some new ones? The following board game meetups happen every week in Berlin, and are always friendly to newcomers.

## Board game meetups

On **Tuesdays** from 6PM to 11PM, it's also board game night at [Brettspielegruppe Schöneberg](http://brettspielegruppe.de/), Klixstraße 2 in Schöneberg. This meetup is organized by Brettspielegruppe Schöneberg. Entrance is 3€ per person, and you must bring your own drinks.

On **Wednesdays** at 7PM, [Spieletreff Berlin](http://www.spieletreff-berlin.de/) organizes a board game night in the Gemeindehaus on Nazarethkirchstraße 50 in Wedding. 30 to 40 participants show up each week to play one of the 150 available board games. Entrance is 2€ per person, and drinks are sold on premises.

On **Thursdays** at 7PM, [RuDi](https://www.rudizentrum.de/) hosts the [board game meetup](https://www.meetup.com/berlin-board-gamers/) in Friedrichshain. There is usually a few dozen players gathering there, and dozens of board games to choose from. You will find an equal proportion of English and German-speaking players there. Entrance is 1€ per person, and drinks and snacks are 1.50€ each.

This group has been meeting for over 6 years already, and is always looking for new participants. Entrance is 1€ per person, but you must brink your own drinks. This is a mostly German-speaking group.

On **the first Sunday of the month** at 5PM, BrewDog Berlin Mitte organizes a beer and board games night which they announce on [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/brewdogberlinmitte/). This is an irregular event, so check on Facebook before showing up!
