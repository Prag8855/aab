The freelance visa is a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) for self-employment in Germany.

With a freelance visa, you can...

- Live in Germany
- [Start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or [become a freelancer](/guides/become-a-freelancer-in-germany)
- Bring your family to Germany[^14]
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa[^54]
- Become a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 60 months[^55]

The [artist visa](/glossary/Artist%20visa) and the language teacher visa are the same thing as the freelance visa.

This guide explains how to apply for a freelance visa in Berlin or in your country.

## Who needs a freelance visa?

The freelance visa is a type of [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). You need a residence permit to live in Germany if you are not a citizen or permanent resident of the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), [[EEA]] or Switzerland.

**[Who needs a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit)**

Your current residence permit might allow self-employment:

- **[[Work visa]]** or **[[Blue Card]]**  
    Look on your Zusatzblatt. Your work visa or Blue Card might let you work and freelance at the same time. To freelance full-time, you need a freelance visa. Check your work contract; you might need your employer's permission to freelance.[^44]
- **[[Student visa]]**  
    Your student visa does not allow self-employment by default.[^1] The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* can allow you to study and freelance at the same time.[^2]
- **[Permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)**  
    You can already be self-employed. You don't need a freelance visa.
- **Other residence permits**  
    If you live in Germany for a few years, you might have an unrestricted residence permit. It lets you do any kind of work you want. Check your Zusatzblatt to see what you can do.

## Freelance visa requirements

To get a freelance visa, you need...

- [ ] **Self-employed work**  
    You must be self-employed. You can't be an employee with social benefits. [Fake self-employment](/glossary/Scheinselbstständigkeit) is not allowed.[^3] If you only have one client, you might not get the freelance visa.
- [ ] **Clients in Germany**  
    Some of your clients must be in Germany. If all your clients are in another country, you won't get a freelance visa.[^9] You must prove this with [letters of intent](/glossary/Absichtserkl%C3%A4rung). Your business must have a positive effect on the local economy.
- [ ] **Enough income**  
    You must make enough money to support yourself. In Berlin, your income must be more than your rent, plus your health insurance, plus {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month.[^49] The minimum amount is different in other cities.[^53]
- [ ] **Qualifications for your work**  
    You must know how to do your job. For example, you can't be a freelance musician if you can't make music. You don't need professional training or a university degree.
- [ ] **Permission to do this job**  
    You must have all the permits and special qualifications needed for the job.[^56] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need special qualifications. - [Find the requirements for your job](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)
- [ ] **A plan that makes sense**  
    During the freelance visa interview, they check if your business idea makes sense, how much investment it requires, the effects on employment, and your contribution to innovation and research.[^7]

If you are over 45 years old, you must have...[^14]

- [ ] **A retirement pension**  
    It must guarantee {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur}}€ per month for at least 12 years when you are 67 years old.
- [ ] or **{{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_PENSION|cur}}€ in assets**[^14]  
    You must have this much value in assets by the time you are 67 years old. {# What does that mean? #}

**You do not need to speak German** to get a freelance visa.[^57]

**You do not need a university degree** to get a freelance visa.

## Freelance visa alternatives

{# Working Holiday Visa? Job Seeker Visa? Work visa and Blue Card? #}

If you can't get a Blue Card, there are other [residence permits](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that let you live in Germany.

**[More residence permit options ➞](/guides/residence-permit#types-of-residence-permits)**

### Artist visa

The [artist visa](/glossary/Artist%20visa) does not exist. It's just a freelance visa.

In Berlin and Hamburg, artists get a freelance visa faster. You get your freelance visa during the *Ausländerbehörde* interview.[^11] You don't wait a few weeks like other people.

This guide shows you how to get the freelance visa as an artist. The instructions are the same.

### Language teacher visa

The language teacher visa does not exist. It's just a freelance visa. This guide shows you how to get the freelance visa as a language teacher. The instructions are the same.

## How to apply in Germany

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and prepare your freelance visa application.

It's easier to find clients, [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) and prepare your application if you are in Germany.

- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for clients, and apply for the freelance visa in Germany.[^10] You can't work before you get your freelance visa. {# Not true, exception for artists #}
- **If you have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    Your current residence permit stays valid until you get your freelance visa. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon) while you wait, you don't need to leave Germany. If your current residence permit allows self-employment, you can already start your business.
- **If you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)**  
    You can come to Germany, look for clients, and apply for the freelance visa in Germany.[^15] {# Can you start freelancing then? #}
- **If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**  
    You can't apply for a freelance visa with a tourist visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^18]

### 2. Prepare your freelance visa application

Before you apply for the freelance visa, you must...

- [ ] **Find a place to live**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-one-address).
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your rent can't be higher than your income.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a freelance visa.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Get health insurance**  
    You need [valid health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-work-visa-or-blue-card). Travel insurance is not accepted. [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance. Their help is free. - [How to choose health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance)
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**
    This takes time. Start a few weeks before your *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment.

### 2. Book your residence permit appointment

You must get an appointment at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Do this as soon as possible**, because it can take months to get an appointment.

**[How to get an Ausländerbehörde appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**

If you can't find an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment online, you can [apply by email](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#by-email). [If your current residence permit expires soon](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you can usually stay in Germany until you get your new residence permit.

### 3. Open a bank account

You don't need a bank account to apply for a freelance visa, but it will be useful later.[^19] You need a bank account to [register your business](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung), [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), pay your visa application fee, pay your rent, and pay your taxes, etc.

Usually, you need a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) to get a bank account. [Some banks](/guides/german-banks-no-address) let you open an account without it.

**[German banks for expats ➞](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany#german-banks-for-expats)**

If you can, have 2 bank accounts: one for you, and one for your business. It's not required, but it's a good idea. It makes accounting easier. I have a personal bank account with [N26](/out/n26), and a business account with [Kontist](/out/kontist).

You will need money in your German bank account. I used [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from Canada to Germany.

### 4. Register your address

You don't need to [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin) to get the freelance visa, but it will be useful later. You must register your address to get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung) and a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer). You need that to [register your business](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung) with the *[[Finanzamt]]*.

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

If you can't register your address before your visa interview, bring your apartment lease and your *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]* instead.

### 5. Get health insurance

You need health insurance to get a German freelance visa.

**[Which health insurance is valid for a freelance visa? ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)**

**[How to choose German health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

Many visa applications are rejected because of invalid health insurance. German [public](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) and [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) is always valid. [[Expat health insurance]] from [Feather](/out/feather-expats), [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats) and [Care Concept](/out/care-concept) is also valid. Cheap expat health insurance is often rejected.

If you just moved to Germany and never had German health insurance, you might be forced to get private health insurance or expat health insurance. Public health insurers often reject freelancers from non-EU countries.

If you don't know which health insurance to choose, **just talk to a health insurance broker**. They will help you find the best, cheapest health insurance for your situation. You will be 100% sure that your insurance is valid for your visa application, and that you have good coverage. Their help is free.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

I work with [Feather Insurance](/out/feather) since 2018. They helped me get private health insurance and save over 400€ per month. They speak English, and they have a lot of experience with expat freelancers.

**If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher**, you can apply for the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* after you get your freelance visa. They will pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung). It's a really good deal.

**[How to join the Künstlersozialkasse ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

### 6. Prepare the required documents

You need a few weeks to prepare the documents for your application. The [letters of intent](/glossary/Absichtserkl%C3%A4rung) are the hardest to find. Look for them as soon as you can. Documents from your tax advisor can also take a long time to prepare.

**[List of required documents ↓](/guides/freelance-visa#required-documents)**

### 7. Go to your freelance visa interview

**[What happens at the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

You must go to your interview at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* [on Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://service.berlin.de/standort/121885/). It takes around 1 hour. Bring all your documents with you.

Your interview will probably be in German. Some interviewers speak English, but this is not guaranteed. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter with you. If you can afford it, [bring an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin). I usually work with Kathleen Parker at [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation). [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) can also go to the *Ausländerbehörde* with you.

### 8. Receive your freelance visa

**[If your visa application is approved ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-application-is-approved)**

**[If your visa application is rejected ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-application-is-rejected)**

Some people get their freelance visa immediately during the interview.[^20] Other people must wait 6 to 10 weeks on average. It's very random. It depends on your field, and on how well you have prepared. Artists and language teachers almost always get the freelance visa during the interview. Software developers sometimes get it during the interview,[^21] and sometimes later.

When you get your freelance visa, it can be valid for 6 months to 3 years.[^22] When your visa is about to expire, you can renew it.

**[How to renew a freelance visa ➞](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)**

### 9. Start your business

Once you have your visa, you still have some work to do before you can run a business in Germany.

1. If you are a *[[Gewerbetreibender]]*, you must [get a *Gewerbeschein*](/guides/gewerbeschein). If you are a *[[Freiberufler]]* (according to [the Finanzamt's definition](/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe)), you don't need one.[^23]
2. You must [register your business at the tax office](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung) (*[[Finanzamt]]*). This is how you get a tax number (*[[Steuernummer]]*), a VAT number (*[[Umsatzsteuernummer]]*), and an entry in the trade register (*[[Handelsregister]]*).
3. Your website must follow the [German and European Union laws](/guides/website-compliance-germany).
4. You can get [professional liability insurance](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung) (*Gewerbehaftpflichtversicherung* or *Berufshaftpflichtversicherung*) to protect yourself against lawsuits. You can also get disability insurance (*[[Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung]]*), in case you get injured and can't work.

## How to apply in your country

### 1. Get your appointment at the German embassy or consulate

You must get an appointment at [your local German embassy or consulate](/out/consulate-finder). It can be hard to find an appointment. You might only get an appointment 2-3 months later.[^24] Start looking as soon as possible.

### 2. Prepare for your visa interview

Before you go to your visa interview, prepare the [required documents](/guides/freelance-visa#required-documents). You also need [health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa) and [a place to live in Germany](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin). In your case, you might need expat health insurance for a few months, until you can get public or private health insurance. [[Expat health insurance]] from [Feather](/out/feather-expats), [Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats) and [Care Concept](/out/care-concept) is valid. A [health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) can help you choose the correct health insurance.

The list of required documents is different in each country. Check the website of your local embassy or consulate. The list on this page is for people who apply at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* in Berlin.

### 3. Go to your visa interview

You must go to your interview and give your documents. If you have all the required documents, the interview only takes a few minutes.

### 4. Receive your temporary visa

You must go to the embassy or consulate again. They will give you a temporary visa that lets you enter Germany and start working. The temporary visa is [a sticker in your passport](/images/aufenthaltstitel.jpg).

### 5. Come to Germany

After you get your visa, you can [travel to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin).

You can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany. You will need to [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), [get a tax ID](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id), [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany) and a few other things. You can find an apartment, open a bank account and get health insurance before you arrive in Germany. It will save you some time.

### 5. Start your business

**[How to start a business in Germany ➞](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**

### 6. Convert your temporary visa to a residence permit

Your temporary visa is usually valid for 6 months. You must go to the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* and convert your temporary visa to a freelance visa. Your freelance visa will be valid for up to 3 years.

## Required documents

These documents are required for your freelance visa application.

Your documents can be in English, but it's better if they are in German. If they are not in English or German, you might need a translation. For official documents like certificates and diplomas, you need a [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung).

Some interviewers will look at every document. Some interviewers will ignore most of the documents. It's important to be prepared, but don't worry too much about every detail.

The interviewer will scan your documents page by page. Do not staple the pages together. If possible, print everything on A4 paper.

If you need to translate documents to German, use [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [Lingoking](/out/lingoking-letters).

### Selbständiger or Freiberufler?

There are two types of self-employed people:

- **Freelancers** (*Freiberufler*)  
    Artists, teachers, scientists, engineers, software developers and other professionals with special qualifications.[^5] If you sell professional services, you might be a freelancer.
- **Tradespeople** (Selbständiger/[[Gewerbetreibender]])  
    If you are not a *Freiberufler*, you are a *Gewerbetreibender*. If you sell products, you are a *Gewerbetreibender*. Immigration law uses "*Selbständiger*". Tax law uses "*Gewerbetreibender*". It means the same thing.[^52] {# If you sell non-skilled work... #}

The difference is important. You get a different type of freelance visa. The [required documents](#required-documents) are different.

**[Difference between Freiberufler and Gewerbetreibender ➞](/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe)**

### Basic documents

- **Freelance visa application form, filled** (*Antrag auf Erteilung eines Aufenthaltstitels*)  
    *[Template](/docs/residence-permit-application-form) - [detailed guide](https://www.essentialpackingchecklists.com/german-freelance-visa-application-form/)*

- **Appointment confirmation**  
    This document shows a lot of useful information about your appointment.
- **2 passport photos**  
    *[Detailed guide](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)*  
    You need two 35 × 45 mm biometric pictures. [There are many ways to get biometric photos in Berlin](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin), including from the photo booth at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^26] You do not need to cut the passport photos yourself; they have a tool for this.[^27]
- **{{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€ for the visa application fees**  
    The [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://service.berlin.de/standort/121885/) *Ausländerbehörde* accepts [[Girocard]], cash, Visa and Mastercard.[^28] The visa application fee is between 28€ and {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€.[^25] You only pay when you get your freelance visa. If you don't get it, you don't need to pay anything. The *Ausländerbehörde* [now accepts credit cards](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#how-to-pay-the-residence-permit-fee), but bring enough cash just in case.
- **Proof of health insurance coverage**  
    *[Detailed guide](https://blog.holvi.com/expats-guide-health-insurance-in-germany-freelancers)*  
    Health insurance coverage is mandatory in Germany. You must prove that you are covered by an approved health insurance company. [The previous section](/guides/freelance-visa#step-5-get-health-insurance) has more details.
- **Proof of residence in Berlin** *([[Anmeldebestätigung]] or [[Meldebescheinigung]])  
    [Detailed guide](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung)* - *[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung template](/docs/wohnungsgeberbestatigung)*  
    You must prove that you have a place to live in Berlin. It must be big enough: there must be at least 9 m^2^ per person in the apartment. If you rent a room, it must be at least 6 m^2^. Student residences and communal accommodations are also accepted.[^50]
    - **Your [[Anmeldebestätigung]]**  
        You get this document during your *[[Anmeldung]]*. If you don't have it, it's okay; just bring the lease and the [[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]. If you can, bring proof that you have a *Bürgeramt* appointment to register your address.
    - **and your lease**  
        Bring this document even if you have your *[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*. Some interviewers require it anyway.[^29] Temporary leases are accepted.[^30]
    - **and the [[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]**  
        You get this document from your landlord after you sign a lease. It confirms that you are allowed to live there. Bring this document even if you have your *[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*. Many interviewers require it anyway.[^31] You can find a template [here](/docs/wohnungsgeberbestatigung).

### Professional information

- **2 or more recommendation letters**  
    Some interviewers will ask for letters of recommendation.[^32] These are letters from your previous employers, clients or professors that recommend you for your work. The letters must recommend you for the profession you are getting a visa for. If possible, these letters should be signed.
- **CV or resume**  
    Bring a resume to help you reference your professional experience. Make the resume relevant to the visa you are applying for. Don't include irrelevant experience or summer jobs here.
- **Cover letter** (*Anschreiben*)  
    [Example 1](/docs/freelance-visa-cover-letter) - [example 2](/images/German-freelance-visa-cover-letter-example.png)  
    Some interviewers simply don’t care about your cover letter, but it's good to have one. It should be in German, in case your interviewer doesn't speak English. Don't forget to sign the letter. If you need to translate documents, use [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [Lingoking](/out/lingoking).
- **Portfolio / examples of your work**  
    This is not required, but it's useful.[^19] It helps you explain what you do. Bring *printed* samples of your work. You need printed examples; a website address will not work.[^33]
- **Professional permit** *(if applicable)*  
    If you need a permit to perform your profession (for example, law or medicine), bring it to your interview.
- **Proof of education** *(optional)*  
    If you have relevant degrees or certifications, they can prove that you are qualified. Bring the original diplomas, and copies for the interviewer.[^34]
    - **Certified translations**  
        If your degrees or diplomas are not in English or German, bring [certified translations](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung).[^51]
- **Passport**  
    The interviewer will use your passport to identify you. If you get the visa immediately, the interviewer will put it in your passport. The freelance visa is a sticker that goes in your passport.[^35]

### Proof of self-sufficiency

- **Bank statement** (*[[Kontoauszug]]*)  
    This shows how much savings you have. It proves that you have enough money to support yourself while you start your business. The more money you have in your account, the better. *In general*, bank statements from foreign banks are accepted, but some interviewers want statements from a German bank.[^36] Just [open a German bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), and transfer some savings with [Wise](/out/transferwise). According to [this poll](https://www.facebook.com/groups/berlinfreelancers/permalink/1899819730098402/?comment_id=1899832836763758), 3,000€ to 5,000€ in savings is enough.[^37] If necessary, convert the amount to Euros.[^38]
- **Revenue forecast / profit and loss statement** (*[[Ertragsvorschau]]*)  
    *[Template and instructions](/docs/ertragsvorschau)*  
    Make a spreadsheet of your *expected* monthly business income and expenses. Your numbers should be realistic, but ambitious. Some [Ausländerbehörde] employee prefer that you use the [official template](/docs/ertragsvorschau).
- **Proof of adequate pension plan**  
    If you are over 45 years old, you need to prove that you have adequate preparations for retirement. See the [section above](#the-german-freelance-visa-requirements) for more details. No proof is required for these nationalities: Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the United States.[^25]
- **Proof of regular income** *(artists and language teachers only)*  
    If you apply as an artist or language teacher in Berlin, you must prove that you will have a regular income. This can be your own savings, regular bank transfers from your family, or a letter from a guarantor.[^5]

### Business strategy

- **Business plan** (not required for **[[Freiberufler]]**)  
    *[Detailed guide 1](http://www.existenzgruender.de/EN/Die-ersten-Schritte/Gruendung-planen/inhalt.html) - [detailed guide 2](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/working-in-germany/setting-up-business/preparation-consultation/business-plan)*  
    In order to get a German freelance visa, you must prove that there is an economic interest or a regional need for your services. In your business plan, you must highlight how you plan to find work and grow your business.[^46] This document is a summary of the company profile, capital requirement plan, business concept and financing plan. You can write your business plan in English or in German.
    - **Company profile** (not required for *[[Freiberufler]]*)  
        *[Template](/images/firmenprofil.pdf)*  
        This document gives all the important information about your company: official proof of its existence, names of managing directors, total equity, annual turnover, official business address in your city, official function etc.[^39] The company profile can be in English or in German.[^40]
    - **Capital requirement plan** (not required for *[[Freiberufler]]*)  
        This document details all the expenses you plan for starting your business: equipment purchases, real estate, licensing fees, vehicle fleet etc.
    - **Business concept** (not required for *[[Freiberufler]]*)  
        *[Template](http://www.berlin.de/labo/_assets/zuwanderung/geschaeftskonzept.pdf)*  
        This document contains the industry, the target customers, marketing and sales strategy and the market forecasts of your company.
- **Financing plan / Capital budget** *(Finanzierungsplan)*  
    *[Template](/docs/financing-plan-template) - [instructions](https://www.essentialpackingchecklists.com/german-freelance-visa-finance-forms/)*  
    This document details how you plan to finance your business. In this document, you must list your liquid funds, tangible assets, loans, venture capital etc.[^39]
- **2 or more [letters of intent](/glossary/Absichtserkl%C3%A4rung) or contracts** (*[[Absichtserklärung]]*)  
    *[Template](/docs/german-freelance-visa-letter-of-intent) - [example](/docs/letter-of-intent-example-german-freelance-visa) - [detailed guide](/guides/freelance-visa-letter-of-intent)*  
    These letters come from potential clients that want to hire you. They are not necessarily contracts; they only show that companies have the *intention* to hire you. These letters are *really* important.[^41] They prove that you can find work in Germany. Letters of intent in German and from German companies are preferred, and sometimes required.[^42] Signed contracts are better than letters of intent. Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees want letters with salary information.[^43]
