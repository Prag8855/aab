## Step 1: Buy a ticket

### Where to buy a ticket

To use **intercity trains** (IC and ICE), buy a ticket from the [Deutsche Bahn website](https://bahn.de), in the DB Navigator app, a DB Reisezentrum or a DB ticket machine. You can't buy tickets on the train.

To use **everything else** ([[S-Bahn]], [[U-Bahn]], tram, bus, ferry), buy a local public transit ticket. It lets you travel in Berlin and parts of Brandenburg.

You can buy local public transit tickets...

- **At a ticket machine**  
    Find a [yellow or red ticket machine](/images/VBB-ticket-machine.jpg) at the train station. The machines are on the train platforms, near the exits. You can pay with coins, bills, credit cards and [Girocards](/glossary/Girocard). You can sometimes pay with Apple Pay and Google Pay. The ticket machines speak many languages. Don't forget to [stamp your ticket](#step-2-validate-your-ticket).
- **In the app**  
    Buy tickets on your phone. Pay with a credit card, Apple Pay or Google Pay. Your ticket is valid 1 minute after you buy it. You need internet access to buy tickets. There is Wi-Fi at most train stations.
    - **[Jelbi app](https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/)**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
        You can also rent cars, bicycles, scooters and mopeds with this app. It's in English and German.
    - **[BVG app](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps)**  
        It's in English and German.
    - **[VBB app](https://www.vbb.de/en/driving-information/apps/)**  
        You can buy tickets for Berlin and [[Brandenburg]]. It's a little harder to use.
- **On the tram**  
    Find a [yellow ticket machine](/images/berlin-bvg-tram-ticket-machine.jpg) near the middle of the tram. The old machines only accept coins. The new machines only accept cards.[^1]
- **On the bus**  
    Enter at the front of the bus, and buy a ticket from the driver. Tap your card or phone on the payment terminal near the driver.[^15] If you pay cash, ask the driver for a ticket.[^14]
- **At [[S-Bahn]] and [[BVG]] service points**  
    Buy tickets at [S-Bahn](https://sbahn.berlin/en/tickets/sale-and-contact/points-of-sale/) and [BVG service points](https://www.bvg.de/en/service-and-support/customer-centers-and-shops).

**At the airport**, there are ticket machines on the way to the train platforms, just before you go downstairs. You can also install the [BVG ticket app](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps) before you arrive in Berlin. The airport is in zone C, so you must buy an ABC ticket.

![A public transit ticket machine at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport](/images/ber-ticket-machine.jpg "Ticket machine at the Berlin-Brandenburg airport")

### What ticket to buy

To buy a local public transit ticket...

1. **Choose the [tariff zone ➞](#tariff-zones)**  
    Berlin has [3 tariff zones](#tariff-zones): A, B and C. Buy an AB or ABC ticket, depending on the zones you travel in. **Most things are in zone A or B.** The airport is in zone C.
2. **Choose the [duration of the ticket ➞](#ticket-duration)**  
    Single tickets are valid for 2 hours in one direction. There are daily, weekly and monthly passes. Short trip tickets (*Kurzstrecke*) let you travel just a few stops.
3. **Choose the [type of ticket ➞](#ticket-types)**  
    There are cheaper tickets for children, students, apprentices and [dogs](#dogs-on-public-transit). You need a [ticket for your bicycle](#bicycles-on-public-transit). Daily, weekly and monthly passes sometimes let you bring people for free.

Your ticket is valid for the [[S-Bahn]], the [[U-Bahn]], trams, buses, ferries, regional trains (RE) and [*some* IC and ICE trains](https://www.vbb.de/vbb-services/umsteigen-und-weiterfahren/bahn/#c1155). It's not valid for private buses (Flixbus, *Hop-On, Hop-Off*) and tour boats.

![A digital Deutschland Ticket in the BVG app](/images/bvg-app-digital-deutschland-ticket.jpg "A digital ticket in the BVG app")

### Tariff zones

Berlin has 3 public transit zones: A, B and C.

- **Zone A** is central Berlin. It's everything inside the *[[Ringbahn]]*; all the central neighbourhoods.
- **Zone B** is everything outside the *Ringbahn*, but inside Berlin.
- **Zone C** is outside of Berlin. It includes parts of [[Brandenburg]] like the Berlin-Brandenburg airport, Potsdam and Oranienburg.

Most things are in zone A or B, so you usually need an AB ticket. If you go to the airport, you need an ABC ticket.

[![Bvg tarifbereiche](/images/bvg-tarifbereiche.svg "Berlin public transit tariff zones")](/images/bvg-tarifbereiche.svg)

If you already have an AB ticket, and you want to go to zone C, get an [extention ticket (*Anschlussfahrausweis*)](https://sbahn.berlin/en/tickets/all-tickets/single-tickets/extension-ticket/). It's cheaper than an ABC ticket.

If you have a [[Deutschland Ticket]], you can travel in all zones.

### Ticket duration

**Single tickets** are valid for 2 hours in one direction. You can take as many trains, buses and ferries as you want with the same ticket. You can stop, do some shopping, and take the train again. Your ticket only works in one direction. To go back, you must buy a new ticket.

**Short trip tickets** let you travel 3 train tops, or 6 bus or tram stops. If you buy them in the app, they are valid for 20 minutes.[^2]

**Daily, monthly and weekly passes** are cheaper. They usually let you [bring other people for free](#bring-other-people-for-free).

**The [Deutschland Ticket](/guides/deutschland-ticket)** is a monthly subscription. You can use all public transit in Germany for {{DEUTSCHLAND_TICKET_PRICE|cur}}€ per month.

### Ticket types

- **Standard ticket**  
    This is the ticket most people need.
- **Reduced price ticket** (*Ermäßigungstarif*)  
    Children between 6 and 15 years old need a reduced price ticket. Dogs too. Most tickets let you [bring children for free](#bring-other-people-for-free). Some tickets let you [bring a dog for free](#dogs-on-public-transit).
- **Student ticket** (*Schülerticket*, *Ausbildungsticket*)  
    Students and [apprentices](/glossary/Azubi) get a [free monthly pass](https://www.vbb.de/en/tickets/pupils-apprentices/monthly-ticket/). Apply for it [here](https://www.abo-antrag.de/de/) or [here](https://www.bvg.de/de/abos-und-tickets/alle-abos/schuelerticket-berlin).
- **Bicycle ticket** (*Fahrradkarte*)  
    You need a bicycle ticket for your bicycle. - [How to bring bikes on public transit](#bicycles-on-public-transit).

**[List of ticket types](https://sbahn.berlin/en/tickets/all-tickets/)** - S-Bahn Berlin

### If you get caught without a ticket

There are ticket checkers who enter the train and look at everyone's tickets. They wait until the doors close, so you can't run away. If your ticket is not valid, you get a {{BVG_FINE|cur}}€ fine.

If you have the wrong ticket, you still get a fine.

If you bought your ticket with the app, show them the [ticket QR code](/images/bvg-app-digital-deutschland-ticket.jpg) in the app.

**[How to pay a BVG fine ➞](/guides/paying-a-bvg-fine)**

## Step 2: Validate your ticket

**Stamp your ticket before you use it**. If your ticket is not stamped, it's not valid. There are stamping machines on train platforms, and inside trams and buses. Look for a yellow or red metal box, and put your ticket in the slit.

[![Validate german train ticket](/images/validate-german-train-ticket.jpg "Stamp your ticket to validate it")](/images/validate-german-train-ticket.jpg)

If you buy a ticket on the bus or tram, it's already stamped. Monthly passes are already stamped.[^4]

**Digital tickets** are valid 1 minute after you buy them.[^3] Buy your ticket before you get on the train.

## Step 3: Use public transport

Get on the bus, tram, train or ferry, and go where you want to go. Get directions from [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps)) or [BVG Fahrinfo](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps/fahrinfo-app). BVG Fahrinfo has more accurate information.

### Go in the right direction

[![BVG daisy status display](/images/bvg-daisy-display.jpg)](/images/bvg-daisy-display.jpg)

The display shows a train's last stop, not its direction. For example, the S2's last stop could be in Bernau, Buch or Blankenburg. These trains all go in the same direction, but their last stops are not the same.

### Take the bus or tram

When your bus or tram arrives, stand on the side, and let other people exit before you enter. If you stand in front of the door, you block people who try to leave.

You can use any door to get on the bus. You don't need to show your ticket to the driver.[^16]

Before your stop, press the yellow or red "STOP" button near you. You will hear a "ding" sound. You will see "STOP" in the corner of the information screen. The bus will stop at the next bus stop. 

To open the doors, you might need to press a button near the doors.

## Public transport options

### Inside Berlin

- **S-Bahn trains**  
    The [red and yellow S-Bahn trains](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berlin-_Bahnhof_Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe-_auf_Bahnsteig_zu_Gleis_4-_BVG-Baureihe_480_10.8.2009.jpg) are run by the [[Deutsche Bahn]]. They travel everywhere in Berlin, and in some parts of [[Brandenburg]]. S-Bahn line names start with an S (S1, S2, ...).
- **U-Bahn trains**  
    The [yellow U-Bahn trains](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berlin_U-Bahn_IK_at_Olympia-Stadion_\(3\).jpg) use their own rail network. They travel everywhere in Berlin. They are run by the [[BVG]]. U-Bahn line names start with a U (U1, U2, ...). The "U" is for "underground", but U-Bahn lines are not always underground. At night, U-Bahn trains are replaced by night buses.
- **Trams** (*Straßenbahn*)  
    Some tram lines start with an M (M1, M2...), and others have just a number (50, 68...). Most trams are in the east. Before the [reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification), there were no trams in West Berlin. At night, some tram lines are replaced by night buses. Some tram lines also run at night.
- **Buses**  
    Bus stops have an ["H" sign](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bushaltestelle_S%2BU_Potsdamer_Platz_in_Berlin.jpg) or [post](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berlin-Stadtrundfahrt_Bus_100.jpg). There are night buses that replace U-Bahn and tram lines.[^5] Night bus lines start with the letter N (N6, N7, ...). Their number is the same as the bus or train line they replace (U6 and N6, 50 and N50...).
- **Ferries**  
    There are a few ferries in Berlin.[^6] Ferry lines start with an F (F12, F24, ...).

### Outside of Berlin

- **Regional trains**  
    The Regio trains travel from Berlin to [[Brandenburg]] and other parts of Germany. The express lines start with RE (RE1, RE2...) and the other lines start with RB (RB10, RB49...). There is also the FEX line, which goes to the BER airport.[^7]
- **S-Bahn trains**  
    Most S-Bahn lines end in zone C. Zone C is outside of Berlin, in [[Brandenburg]].
- **Long distance trains**  
    These trains travel to other German cities. The express line names start with ICE. The other lines start with IC. You can board [*some* IC and ICE trains](https://www.vbb.de/vbb-services/umsteigen-und-weiterfahren/bahn/#c1155) with a regular ticket. Use [Omio](https://www.omio.com/) or [Bahn.de](/out/bahn) to find train tickets.

## Bicycles on public transit

You can bring your bicycle on the train (S-Bahn and U-Bahn), on the tram, on ferries, and on the N1 to N9 night buses.[^9] You can't bring your bicycle on other buses. On the U-Bahn, don't bring your bicycle in the first carriage. Some carriages also have a "no bicycles" sign near the door.[^10] On the S-Bahn, only use the carriages with a bicycle sign near the door.[^10]

Bicycle trailers, bicycles with more than two wheels, scooters and motorcycles are not allowed. Electric bicycles are allowed.[^10]

### Bicycle tickets

You must buy a bicycle ticket (*Fahrradticket*) for your bicycle.

If you have a student ticket (*Schülerticket*) or an apprentice ticket (*Ausbildungsticket*), you don't need a bicycle ticket.

If you have a [folding bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_bicycle), you don't need a bicycle ticket, but your bike must be folded when you are on the train. You can also bring your folded bike on the bus and tram.

## Dogs on public transit

In Berlin, you can take your dog with you in trains, trams and buses. They can't go on the seats. They must be in a closed container. If they don't fit in a container, they must wear a muzzle and be on a leash.

Normally, you must buy a reduced price (*Ermäßigungstarif*) ticket for your dog, but there are exceptions. You can bring your dog on the train, tram or bus for free if...[^11]
