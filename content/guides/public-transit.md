## Step 1: Buy a ticket

### One ticket for everything

**With a ticket, you can you use all public transit options**: the [[S-Bahn]], the [[U-Bahn]], trams, buses, ferries, regional trains and [*some* IC and ICE trains](https://www.vbb.de/vbb-services/umsteigen-und-weiterfahren/bahn/#c1155). It does not work on *Hop-On, Hop-Off* sightseeing buses

**Your ticket is valid for 2 hours in one direction**. You can take as many trains, buses and ferries as you want with the same ticket. You can even stop, do some shopping, and take the train again. Your ticket only works in one direction. If you want to go back, you must buy a new ticket.

### Choose the right tariff zone

Berlin has 3 public transit zones: A, B and C:

- **Zone A** includes everything inside the *[[Ringbahn]]*.
- **Zone B** includes everything that's outside the *Ringbahn*, but inside Berlin.
- **Zone C** includes parts of [[Brandenburg]] like the BER airport, Potsdam and Oranienburg.

[![Bvg tarifbereiche](/images/bvg-tarifbereiche.svg "Berlin public transit tariff zones")](/images/bvg-tarifbereiche.svg)

You can buy an AB, BC or ABC ticket, depending on the zones you travel in. Most things are in zones A and B, but the BER airport is in zone C.

If you are caught with the wrong ticket, you get a {{BVG_FINE}}€ fine. It's like riding without a ticket.

If you already have an AB ticket, and you want to go to zone C, get an [extention ticket (*Anschlussfahrausweis*)](https://sbahn.berlin/en/tickets/all-tickets/single-tickets/extension-ticket/). It's cheaper than an ABC ticket.

### Choose the right tariff

There are cheaper tickets for certain situations:

- **Bring a friend for free**  
    If you have a weekly, monthly or yearly ticket, you can [bring a friend for free](/guides/public-transit#bring-other-people-for-free) in the evening, during the weekend, and on public holidays. The *9-Uhr-Karte* and the *10-Uhr-Karte* don't let you bring a friend.
- **Short distances**  
    If you travel less than 4 train stops, or less than 7 bus or tram stops, you can get a [short distance (*Kurzstrecke*) ticket](https://sbahn.berlin/en/tickets/all-tickets/single-tickets/short-trip-ticket/). It's cheaper than the regular ticket.
- **Children**  
    If your child is between 6 and 14 years old, they need a reduced price (*Ermäßigungstarif*) ticket. Children under 6 years old ride for free.[^0]
- **Students and [apprentices](/glossary/Azubi)**  
    Students and [apprentices](/glossary/Azubi) can get a [free monthly pass](https://www.vbb.de/en/tickets/pupils-apprentices/monthly-ticket/) (*Schülerticket* or *Ausbildungsticket*). You can apply for it [here](https://www.abo-antrag.de/de/) or [here](https://1.bvg.de/schuelerticket) (in German).
- **Senior citizens** Senior citizens pay the regular price for tickets. If you are over 64 years old, you can get, but there a cheaper yearly subscription: the [VBB-Abo 65plus](https://www.vbb.de/tickets/abonnements/vbb-abo-65plus/).
- **Dogs**  
    If your dog is bigger than a cat, you must buy a reduced tariff (*Ermäßigungstarif*) ticket for it. Guide dogs and smaller dogs don't need a ticket. If you have a daily, monthly or yearly ticket, your dog can ride for free. - [How to bring dogs on public transit](/guides/public-transit#dogs-on-public-transit).
- **Bicycles**  
    You need a bicycle ticket (*Fahrradkarte*) for your bicycle. - [How to bring bikes on public transit](/guides/public-transit#bicycles-on-public-transit).

### Where to buy tickets

There are many ways to buy a public transit ticket:

- **In the [BVG app](https://www.bvg.de/en/tickets-tariffs/all-apps)**  
    The BVG app is the easiest way to buy train tickets. The app is in English. You must create an account. If your phone runs out of battery, you don't have a valid ticket.
- **In the [VBB app](https://www.vbb.de/en/driving-information/apps/)**  
    The VBB app lets you buy tickets in Berlin and [[Brandenburg]]. You must create an account. It's a little harder to use, but the tickets are the same.
- **In the [Jelbi app](https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/)**  
    The Jelbi app lets you buy train tickets, but also rent cars, bicycles, scooters and mopeds. It's one app for everything. You must create an account.
- **At a ticket machine**  
    There are yellow or red ticket machines at every train station. They accept coins, bills, credit cards and EC cards. Most ticket machines accept Apple Pay and Google Pay. The machines are usually on the train platform near the exits. The machines speak many languages.
- **In the tram**  
    There are ticket machines in every tram. It's a big yellow box near the middle of the tram. The old machines only accept coins. The new machines only accept cards.[^1]
- **In the bus**  
    You can buy tickets at the front of the bus, next to the driver. You must pay with a credit card, an EC Card, Android Pay or Apple Pay.[^2] You can't pay with cash.[^3]
- **At [[S-Bahn]] and [[BVG]] service points**  
    There are a few [S-Bahn](https://sbahn.berlin/en/tickets/sale-and-contact/points-of-sale/) and [BVG service points](https://www.bvg.de/en/service-and-support/customer-centers-and-shops). You can buy tickets there.

[![Berlin bvg tram ticket machine](/images/berlin-bvg-tram-ticket-machine.jpg "An old ticket machine in a BVG tram")](/images/berlin-bvg-tram-ticket-machine.jpg)

### Types of tickets

You can buy a single ticket. It's valid for 2 hours in 1 direction. You can also buy daily, weekly and monthly tickets. There are many more types of tickets.

**[List of ticket types](https://sbahn.berlin/en/tickets/all-tickets/)** - S-Bahn Berlin

### If you get caught without a ticket

There are *Kontrolleur* who enter the train and check everyone's tickets. They wait until the doors close, so you can't run away. If your ticket is not valid, you will get a {{BVG_FINE}}€ fine.

**[How to pay a BVG fine ➞](/guides/paying-a-bvg-fine)**

## Step 2: Validate your ticket

**When you buy a ticket, you must stamp it**. If you don't stamp your ticket, it's not valid. If you are caught with an unstamped you get a {{BVG_FINE}}€ fine. It's like riding without a ticket.

You can validate your ticket at a stamping machine. These machines are on train platforms, and inside trams and buses. Look for a yellow or red metal box.

Tickets from bus drivers and tram machines don't always need to be stamped. Monthly cards don't need to be stamped.[^4]

[![Validate german train ticket](/images/validate-german-train-ticket.jpg "Stamp your ticket to validate it")](/images/validate-german-train-ticket.jpg)

## Step 3: Use public transport

Get on the bus, tram, train or ferry, and go where you want to go. Get directions from [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps)) or [BVG Fahrinfo](https://www.bvg.de/en/tickets-tariffs/all-apps/fahrinfo-app).

### On the bus

When your stop is coming, you must request the bus to stop. Press the yellow or red button close to you. You will hear a "ding" sound. The "STOP" sign will appear on the information screen. The bus will stop at the next bus stop.

### On the tram

At night, the tram does not stop at every station. Press the yellow or red STOP button close to you. You will hear a "ding" sound. The "STOP" sign will appear on the information screen. The tram will stop at the next station.

### Go in the right direction

[![Bvg daisy display](/images/bvg-daisy-display.jpg)](/images/bvg-daisy-display.jpg)

The display shows a train's last stop, not its direction. For example, if an S2 train goes north, its last stop could be in Bernau, Buch or Blankenburg. These trains all go in the same direction, and they stop at the same stations, but their last stops are at different stations.

## Public transport options

### Inside Berlin

- **S-Bahn trains**  
    The [red and yellow S-Bahn trains](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berlin-_Bahnhof_Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe-_auf_Bahnsteig_zu_Gleis_4-_BVG-Baureihe_480_10.8.2009.jpg) are run by the [[Deutsche Bahn]]. They travel everywhere in Berlin, and in some parts of [[Brandenburg]]. S-Bahn line names start with an S (S1, S2, ...).
- **U-Bahn trains**  
    The [yellow U-Bahn trains](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berlin_U-Bahn_IK_at_Olympia-Stadion_(3).jpg) use their own rail network. They travel everywhere in Berlin. They are run by the [[BVG]]. U-Bahn line names start with a U (U1, U2, ...). The "U" is for "underground", but U-Bahn lines are not always underground. At night, U-Bahn trains are replaced by night buses.
- **Trams** (*Straßenbahn*)  
    Some tram lines start with an M (M1, M2...), and others have just a number (50, 68...). Most trams are in the east. Before the [reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification), there were no trams in West Berlin. At night, some tram lines are replaced by night buses. Other tram lines also at night.
- **Buses**  
    Bus stops have an ["H" sign](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bushaltestelle_S%2BU_Potsdamer_Platz_in_Berlin.jpg) or [post](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Berlin-Stadtrundfahrt_Bus_100.jpg). There are night buses that replace U-Bahn and tram lines.[^5] Night bus lines start with the letter N (N6, N7, ...). Their number is the same as the bus or train line they replace (U6 and N6, 50 and N50...).
- **Ferries**  
    There are a few ferries in Berlin.[^6] Ferry lines start with an F (F12, F24, ...).

### Outside of Berlin

- **Regional trains**  
    The Regio trains travel from Berlin to [[Brandenburg]] and other parts of Germany. The express lines start with RE (RE1, RE2...) and the other lines start with RB (RB10, RB49...). There is also the FEX line, which goes to the BER airport.[^7]
- **S-Bahn trains**  
    Most S-Bahn lines end in zone C. Zone C is outside of Berlin, in [[Brandenburg]].
- **Long distance trains**  
    These trains travel to other German cities. The express line names start with ICE. The other lines start with IC. You can board [*some* IC and ICE trains](https://www.vbb.de/vbb-services/umsteigen-und-weiterfahren/bahn/#c1155) with a regular ticket. Use [Omio](https://www.omio.com/) or [Bahn.de](/out/bahn) to find train tickets.

Some carriages also have a "no bicycles" sign near the door.[^10] On the S-Bahn, only use the carriages with a bicycle sign near the door.[^10]

Bicycle trailers, bicycles with more than two wheels, scooters and motorcycles are not allowed on the train. Electric bicycles are allowed.[^10]
