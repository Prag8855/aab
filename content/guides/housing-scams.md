In Germany, it's really hard to [find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin). People are desperate to find an apartment, and scammers take advantage of that.

This guide explains common apartment scams, and how to avoid them.

## Common scams

### Landlord in another country

This is a common scam.[^3] The landlord is not in Germany, but wants to mail the keys after you pay a [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). The apartment does not exist. They will steal your deposit money, and disappear.

### Fake apartment visits

You are invited to view an apartment. The person shows you a rented place that does not belong to them. They take your deposit and disappear.

### Short-term lease

Fixed-term leases are only valid in some situations.[^0] The lease must specify *why* it's fixed term, or the clause is invalid, and you can stay for as long as you want. This also applies to sublets, but not to student residences and vacation apartments. This is not always a scam; many landlords just don't know the law.

### Furnished apartments

Rents are limited by the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]*, but that does not apply to furnished apartments. Landlords pretend that the apartment is furnished to charge more rent. [Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse) can help you reduce your rent.

### You must buy the furniture

Sometimes, the previous tenant (*Vormieter*) wants to sell all their furniture or kitchen to you.[^1] If you don't take the furniture, you don't get the apartment. They often charge too much, because they know that someone will buy it to get the apartment. Overcharging for furniture is illegal.[^12] If you paid too much for furniture, you can get your money back.[^14] [Get legal help.](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)

### Bribes and finder's fee

The landlord or the previous tenant can't ask for a finder's fee, a bribe or a *[[Provision]]* to get the apartment.[^13] If you paid a bribe to get your apartment, you can get your money back, and still keep the apartment.[^2] [Get legal help.](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)

### Agent fees

You never pay an agent fee (*[Maklergebühr](/glossary/Provision)** or *[[Provision]]*), unless *you* hired the agent.[^4] Temporary apartments might have a booking fee.[^5] If you did not hire the agent and still paid a *[[Provision]]*, you can get your money back, and still keep the apartment.[^2] [Get legal help.](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)

### Identity theft

The scammer creates fake apartment listings. When you apply for the apartment, you must send many documents, like a passport and a bank account statement. They use those documents you send to steal your identity.[^6]

## How to avoid scams

### Wait before you pay

Don't send any money before you see the apartment in person and sign the lease.[^7] You have [until the day you move in](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution) to pay the rent and the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). You can [pay the deposit in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You never have to pay a fee to see an apartment, or to apply for it.[^11]

### Wait before you send documents

Don't send your pay slips, your *[[Steuerbescheid]]* or a copy of your passport before you see the apartment. You don't need to share these documents to visit an apartment, only to apply for it. You should censor the parts of the documents that they don't need to see.

### See the apartment in person

A scammer could show you any apartment in a video call. Even in person, they can show you an apartment that they rented for a few days.

### Only pay by bank transfer

In Germany, people pay their rent by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). Never send money by Western Union or other payment services.[^8] If you pay with cash, ask for a receipt. Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from another country. You have until the day you [move in](/guides/moving-in) to pay the rent and the deposit, so you can also come to Germany, [open a bank account](/guides/german-banks-no-address), then pay your rent.

### Use common sense

If the rent is too low, it's probably a scam.[^9] There are no cheap furnished apartments in the centre. If it's too easy to get the apartment, it's probably a scam.

### Look at the account age

Scammers often use a new account to publish apartment listings. If the account is only a few days old, be careful.

### Use Google

Search the landlord's name and [[IBAN]] on Google. You can also search for parts of their messages on Google.[^10] If they are a scammer, you might find some warnings online, or identical ads with different photos. If the IBAN does not start with "DE", be careful.

### Use Google Street View

Scammers often use photos of a different apartment. Use [reverse image search](https://tineye.com/) to see if the photos come from another listing. Check if the apartment looks the same on the photos and on Google Street View. Is the balcony the same? Are the windows the same shape?
