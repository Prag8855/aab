This guide describes common apartment scams in Germany, and how to avoid them.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Scams by thieves

### Landlord in another country

The landlord says that they are in another country. To see the apartment, you must pay a deposit, and they will send you the key. The apartment does not exist. They will steal your money and disappear.[^3]

Scammers often write in bad German or English. They might send a passport photo before you ask for it. They often use fake accounts that are only a few days old.

### Fake apartment visits

Scammers rent someone's apartment while they are on vacation. You visit the apartment, sign a lease, pay a deposit and pay the rent. When it's time to [move in](/guides/moving-in), someone already lives there. The real tenant is back from their vacation. You can't move in. The scammers stole your money.[^15]

This scam is harder to avoid. Verify who really lives there. Check if their name is on the doorbell. Ask to see their ID. Ask the neighbours who really lives there.

### Identity theft

Scammers create fake apartment listings. To [apply for the apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#step-5-apply-for-the-apartment), you must send personal documents. They use your documents to [steal your identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft).[^6]

[Censor and watermark](#censor-your-documents) your documents. Don't send documents before you need to.

## Scams by landlords and tenants

### Furnished apartments

More and more apartments are furnished, because landlords can charge more for them.[^36]

Furnished apartments are convenient, but usually overpriced. Sometimes, you don't have a choice. Temporary furnished apartments are often your only option when you [move to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin).

If you rent a furnished apartment, it should actually have all the furniture you need. Some landlords include minimum furniture just to bypass rent control laws. Make sure you get all the furniture mentioned on the lease.

[Rent control](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse) also applies to furnished apartments, but it's really hard to enforce. [Get legal help.](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)

**[Find a furnished apartment ➞](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#short-term-and-furnished-apartments)**

### Temporary leases

Usually, German leases don't have an end date. They are unlimited (*unbefristet*).[^34]

Some apartments have temporary leases. On a certain date, the lease expires and you must [move out](/guides/moving-out). Landlords prefer temporary leases, because [rent control laws](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse) don't apply to them, and you can't move out early.[^37]

**Temporary leases are often illegal**, but there are exceptions...[^30]

- **Temporary sublets**  
    People can sublet their room or apartment to you while they are on vacation.
- **Room in the landlord's house**  
    You live in the same house as the landlord, and your room is furnished by them.[^32]
- **Planned personal use** (*Eigenbedarf*)  
    The landlord needs the apartment for themself or their family. The lease must say exactly why the lease is limited, who will move in and why. If it just says "personal use", it's not valid.[^33] If they don't use the apartment in the end, you might be able to stay longer.[^38]
- **Planned renovation**  
    The landlord wants to completely renovate the apartment. The renovations must actually happen.

The lease must say exactly why it's temporary.[^35] If there is no valid reason on your lease, the expiration date is not valid. The lease becomes unlimited.[^31]

Talk to a lawyer or a *[[Mieterverein]]* before you try this.[^39] Do it 4 months before your lease expires.[^41]

**[Where to get legal help ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)**

**This does not apply to hotel rooms and holiday homes.** They can have a short-term lease.[^25] In Berlin, many "holiday homes" are not registered. Their temporary lease might still be illegal.[^40] Ask a lawyer or a *[[Mieterverein]]*.

### Pay a bribe to get the apartment

To get the apartment, you must pay a bribe. Bribes are more and more common.[^23] They are usually illegal.

The landlord or the previous tenant can't charge a fee to give you the apartment.[^13]

### Buy the furniture to get the flat

To get the apartment, you must buy overpriced furniture from the previous tenant. If you don't take the furniture, you don't get the apartment.[^1]

Overcharging for furniture is illegal. You can't pay more than 150% of the items' current value.[^12] For example, the previous tenant can't sell you an old bed and a desk for 2,000€.

The previous tenant does not choose who gets the apartment. Buying their furniture does not guarantee that you will get the apartment. If you already signed the lease, the previous tenant can't force you to buy anything.

If you paid too much, you can get your money back and keep the apartment.[^14] This is not always easy; you might need a lawyer.[^24]

### Agent fees

If you hire an agent (*[[Makler]]*) to help you find an apartment, they can charge a fee (*[[Provision]]*). The maximum fee is 2 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete), plus [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer).[^5]

You must never pay an agent fee if...

- You did not hire the agent[^4]
- or the agent is the landlord, the tenant, the owner or the [administrator](/glossary/Hausverwaltung) of the apartment[^18]
- or you only asked the agent about a listing on their website[^17]
- or you renew an existing lease[^19]

If you paid a fee when you should not have, you have 3 years to request the money back.[^2]

### Service fees

Don't pay anything before you sign a lease. You must pay the rent and 1/3 of the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) before the day your lease starts. There should be no other fees.

You should never pay a fee to...

- View an apartment[^21]
- Apply for an apartment
- Sign an apartment contract ("service fee")[^20]

The booking fees on housing websites are sometimes illegal.[^44]

### Freelancers only

The landlord only accepts self-employed people. Part of the apartment is a commercial space (*Teilgewerblich*).

Commercial spaces are not protected by [rent control laws](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse). The landlord uses this to raise your rent above the limit. This is illegal.[^22]

### The rent is too high

Berlin has [rent control laws](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse). Ask [Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse), a *[[Mieterverein]]* or a lawyer to verify your lease. If your rent is too high, they can help you lower it. Your landlord can't kick you out because you lower your rent.

When you [move in](/guides/moving-in), try to get the last tenant's lease. It really helps to lower your rent.

### Landlord does not return deposit

After you [move out](/guides/moving-out), the landlord must return your [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). It can take a few months. Landlords often try to keep your deposit for illegal reasons.

**[How to get your deposit back ➞](/guides/mietkaution#how-to-get-your-kaution-back)**

## How to avoid scams

### Scam checklist

Signs that it's a scam:[^26]

- [ ] **Is it too good to be true?**  
    If it's too easy to get the apartment, or if the price is too low, it might be a scam.[^9]
- [ ] **Is the apartment real?**  
    If you can't visit the apartment, it's probably a scam. Use [reverse image search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0) to see if the photos come from another website. Check if the text was copied from another listing. Check if the apartment has the same windows in the listing and on Google Street View.
- [ ] **Is the landlord real?**  
    Google the name and [[IBAN]] of the landlord or *[[Hausverwaltung]]*. Check if there are warnings about them. Check if the contact information is the same as on their website. Check if they used the same message to scam other people.[^10]
- [ ] **How old is the account?**  
    Look at the landlord's account on the housing website. If it's a new account with only one listing, be careful. Scam accounts are usually a few days old.
- [ ] **Is the price suspicious?**  
    If the rent is exactly 800€ and the *[[Nebenkosten]]* are exactly 75€, it's suspicious.[^43]
- [ ] **How do you pay?**  
    Germans pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung). Bank transfers to other countries are suspicious; the landlord's [[IBAN]] should start with "DE".[^16] It should be the same IBAN as in their *[[Impressum]]*. Other payment methods like Paypal, Western Union, MoneyGram and cryptocurrencies are usually scams.
- [ ] **Do the names match?**[^27]  
    The names on the email, the doorbell, the mailbox and the website should be the same. Ask the neighbour who lives there.[^28] When you see the landlord in person, you can ask to see their ID.

Some behaviours are suspicious, but not always a scam:

- [ ] The contract in English
- [ ] The landlord has a German name, but can't speak German
- [ ] Really bad German or English grammar
- [ ] The landlord sends you their ID before you ask for it[^29]
- [ ] You can't meet the landlord, only a friend or a relative. Video calls are not possible.

### Never pay in advance

Don't pay anything before you see the apartment in person, sign the lease and get the keys.[^7] You have [until the day you move in](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution) to pay the rent and the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). You can [pay the deposit in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You never have to pay a fee to see an apartment, or to apply for it.[^11]

### Censor your documents

**Watermark your documents.** The documents you send should be unusable by identity thieves. - [Watermark a PDF](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/add-watermark)

**Censor your documents.** Remove bank account numbers, passport numbers and [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer)s from your documents. The safest way to censor a document is to print it, censor it with a pen, and scan it again.

### See the apartment in person

A scammer could show you any apartment in a video call. Even in person, they can show you an apartment that they rented for a few days.

If you are not in Germany, use a platform with verified landlords like [Homelike](/out/homelike), [HousingAnywhere](/out/housinganywhere) or [Spotahome](/out/spotahome). They only pay the landlord after you [move in](/guides/moving-in). If the apartment is not as described, you get your money back.

### Only pay by bank transfer

In Germany, people pay rent by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). Never send money by Western Union or other payment services.[^8] If you pay with cash, ask for a receipt. Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from another country. You have until the day you [move in](/guides/moving-in) to pay the rent and the deposit, so you can also come to Germany, [open a bank account](/guides/german-banks-no-address), then pay your rent.

### Pay later

Wait before you send money.[^42] You must pay the rent and the 1/3 of the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) before you [move in](/guides/moving-in). You never have to pay earlier.

**[How to pay the rent and deposit ➞](/guides/moving-in#pay-the-rent)**

### Report a scam

Report the scam to the website it's on. The scammers did not get you, but they can get someone else.
