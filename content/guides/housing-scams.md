In Germany, it's really hard to [find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin). People are desperate to find an apartment, and scammers take advantage of that.

This guide explains common apartment scams, and how to avoid them.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Scams by thieves

### Landlord in another country

The landlord says that they are in another country. They say that if you pay the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution), they will send you the keys. The apartment does not exist. They will steal your money and disappear.[^3]

### Fake apartment visits

The landlord invites you to see the apartment. The apartment does not belong to them. They only rented the place to show it to you. They will steal your deposit and disappear.[^15]

### Identity theft

The scammer creates fake apartment listings. When you apply for the apartment, you must send many documents, like a passport and a bank account statement. They use those documents you send to steal your identity.[^6]

## Scams by landlords

Fixed-term leases are only valid in some situations.[^0] The lease must specify *why* it's fixed term, or the clause is invalid, and you can stay for as long as you want. This also applies to sublets, but not to student residences and vacation apartments. This is not always a scam; many landlords just don't know the law.

### Furnished apartments

Rents are limited by the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]*, but that does not apply to furnished apartments. Landlords pretend that the apartment is furnished to charge more rent. [Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse) can help you reduce your rent.

### Short-term lease

Usually, German leases are unlimited (*unbefristet*). You can live there as long as you want.

Fixed-term leases are often illegal.

## Scams by other tenants

### Bribes

To get the apartment, you must pay a bribe. It's sometimes called an agent fee (*Maklergebühr*), a commission (*[[Provision]]*) or a finder's fee.

The landlord or the previous tenant can't ask for a finder's fee, a bribe or a *[[Provision]]* to get the apartment.[^13] If you paid a bribe to get your apartment, you can get your money back and keep the apartment.[^16]

### Agent fees

If you hire an agent (*[[Makler]]*) to help you find an apartment, they can charge a fee (*[[Provision]]*). The maximum fee is 2 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete), plus [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer).[^5]

You must never pay an agent fee if...

- You did not hire the agent[^4]
- or the agent is the landlord, the tenant, the owner or the [administrator](/glossary/Hausverwaltung) of the apartment[^18]
- or you only asked the agent about a listing on their website[^17]

If you paid a fee when you should not have, you have 3 years to request the money back.[^2]

### Furniture for sale

To get the apartment you must buy the furniture or the kitchen from the previous tenant. The price is ridiculously high. If you don't take the furniture, you don't get the apartment.[^1]

Overcharging for furniture is illegal.[^12] If you paid too much for furniture, you can get your money back and keep the apartment.[^14]

## How to avoid scams

### Wait before you pay

Don't send any money before you see the apartment in person and sign the lease.[^7] You have [until the day you move in](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution) to pay the rent and the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). You can [pay the deposit in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You never have to pay a fee to see an apartment, or to apply for it.[^11]

### Censor your documents

**Watermark your documents.** The documents you send should be unusable by identity thieves. {# TODO: Watermarking tool #}

**Censor your documents.** Remove bank account numbers, passport numbers and [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer)s from your documents. The safest way to censor a document is to print it, censor it with a pen, and scan it again. {# TODO: Censorship tool #}

### See the apartment in person

A scammer could show you any apartment in a video call. Even in person, they can show you an apartment that they rented for a few days.

### Only pay by bank transfer

In Germany, people pay their rent by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). Never send money by Western Union or other payment services.[^8] If you pay with cash, ask for a receipt. Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from another country. You have until the day you [move in](/guides/moving-in) to pay the rent and the deposit, so you can also come to Germany, [open a bank account](/guides/german-banks-no-address), then pay your rent.

### Use common sense

If the rent is too low, it's probably a scam.[^9] There are no cheap furnished apartments in the centre. If it's too easy to get the apartment, it's probably a scam.

### Look at the account age

Scammers often use a new account to publish apartment listings. If the account is only a few days old, be careful.

### Use Google

Search the landlord's name and [[IBAN]] on Google. You can also search for parts of their messages on Google.[^10] If they are a scammer, you might find some warnings online, or identical ads with different photos. If the IBAN does not start with "DE", be careful.

### Use Google Street View

Scammers often use photos of a different apartment. Use [reverse image search](https://tineye.com/) to see if the photos come from another listing. Check if the apartment looks the same on the photos and on Google Street View. Is the balcony the same? Are the windows the same shape?
