This guide describes common apartment scams in Germany, and how to avoid them.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Scams by thieves

### Landlord in another country

The landlord is not in Germany. To see the apartment, you must pay a [deposit](/glossary/Kaution), and they will send you the key. The apartment does not exist. They will steal your deposit and disappear.[^3]

### Fake apartment viewing

Scammers rent someone's apartment, and pretend to live there. They make you visit the apartment, sign a lease, pay a [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) and pay the rent. When you try to [move in](/guides/moving-in), they keys don't work. The scammers stole your money and disappeared.[^15]

This scam is very hard to avoid, because everything looks normal until you move in. You visit a real apartment, sign real documents and even get apartment keys.

### Identity theft

Scammers create fake apartment listings. When you [apply for the apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#apply-for-the-apartment), they steal your documents, and use them to [steal your identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft).[^6] They might use your documents to scam other people.

## Scams by landlords and tenants

### Furnished apartments

Landlords make more money with furnished apartments, so they are more and more common.[^36] They are convenient, but around 60% more expensive.[^49]

[Rent control](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse) applies to furnished apartments too. Landlords can't overcharge for furniture either. The cost of furniture (*Möblierungszuschlag*) must match the actual value of the furniture.[^48]

Ask a lawyer or a *[[Mieterverein]]* to check your lease. They can tell you if your rent is too high.

**[Where to get legal help ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)**

### Short-term leases

Most German leases are unlimited (*unbefristet*). They have no end date.[^34]

Some apartments have short-term leases. When the lease ends, you must [move out](/guides/moving-out). You can rarely leave sooner or stay longer. Short-term leases allow landlords to raise the rent between tenants. It's a way to evade [rent control laws](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse).

**Temporary leases are often illegal**, but there are exceptions:[^30]

- **Temporary sublets**  
    People can sublet their room or apartment to you while they travel.
- **Room in the landlord's house**  
    You live in the same house as the landlord, and your room is furnished by them.[^32]
- **Planned personal use** (*Eigenbedarf*)  
    The landlord needs the apartment for themself or their family. The lease must say exactly why the lease is limited, who will move in and why. If it just says "personal use", it's not valid.[^33] [Fake *Eigenbedarf*](#eigenbedarf) is another common scam. If they don't use the apartment as described, you might be able to stay longer.[^38]
- **Planned renovation**  
    The landlord wants to completely renovate the apartment. If the renovations don't happen, you might be able to stay longer.
- **Hotels and holiday homes**  
    They can have a short-term lease.[^25] In Berlin, converting an apartment into short-term housing is illegal. If the holiday home is not registered, the short-time lease might be illegal.[^40]

The lease must say exactly why it's temporary.[^35] If there is no valid reason, the expiration date is not valid. The lease becomes unlimited.[^31]

To extend a short-term lease, talk to a lawyer or a *[[Mieterverein]]*.[^39] Do it 4 months before your lease expires.[^41]

**[Where to get legal help ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)**

### Pay a bribe to get the apartment

To get the apartment, you must pay a bribe to the landlord or the previous tenant. Bribes are usually illegal, but they are more and more common.[^23]

You should never pay the landlord, the previous tenant, the owner or the *[[Hausverwaltung]]* to get the apartment.[^18]

### Buy the furniture to get the flat

The previous tenant wants to sell their furniture to you. They usually ask for a ridiculous price. It's a bribe to get the apartment. If you don't buy the furniture, you don't get the apartment.[^1]

Overcharging for furniture is illegal. You can't pay more than 150% of the items' current value.[^12] For example, the previous tenant can't sell you an old bed and a desk for 2,000€. If you paid too much, you can get your money back and keep the apartment.[^14] You might need a lawyer.[^24]

Buying the furniture might not help you. The previous tenant does not choose who gets the apartment. The landlord might still choose someone else. Try to sign the lease without promising anything.

### Agent fees

If you hire an agent (*[[Makler]]*) to help you find an apartment, they can charge a fee (*[[Provision]]*). The maximum fee is 2 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete), plus [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer).[^5]

You must never pay an agent fee if...

- You did not hire the agent[^4]
- or the agent is the landlord, the tenant, the owner or the [administrator](/glossary/Hausverwaltung) of the apartment[^18]
- or you only asked the agent about a listing on their website[^17]
- or you renew an existing lease[^19]

If you paid a fee when you should not have, you have 3 years to request the money back.[^2]

### Service fees

Don't pay anything before you sign a lease. You must pay the rent and 1/3 of the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) before the day your lease starts. There should be no other fees.

You must never pay a fee to...

- View an apartment[^21]
- Apply for an apartment
- Sign an apartment contract ("service fee")[^20]

Some housing websites websites charge a platform fee or a booking fee. These might be illegal.[^44]

### Freelancers only

The landlord only accepts self-employed tenants. Part of the apartment is a commercial space (*Teilgewerblich*).

[Rent control laws](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse) don't apply to commercial spaces. The landlord is trying to raise your rent above the limit. This is illegal.[^22]

### The rent is too high

Berlin has [rent control laws](/glossary/Mietpreisbremse). Landlords can't charge what they want. If you sue your landlord to lower your rent, they can't kick you out. You pay less rent, but keep the apartment.

### Eigenbedarf

Landlords need a valid reason to end your lease and kick you out. Personal use (*Eigenbedarf*) is a valid reason If landlord needs the apartment for their family or themselves, they can kick you out.[^45]

Landlords often use fake *Eigenbedarf* to kick tenants out. Instead of moving in, they sell the empty apartment for a higher price, or raise the rent and find another tenant.[^46] This is illegal.

If this happens to you, [get legal help](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions).[^47] You can usually stop it, delay it, or get paid to move out.

### Landlord does not give the deposit back

After you [move out](/guides/moving-out), the landlord must return your [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). It can take up to 6 months.

The landlord can only use your deposit to repair damage that you caused. It must pay for the exact cost of the damages. The landlord must give you an itemised invoice of the repairs. You can also do the repairs yourself. They can't use the deposit to punish you or fine you.

**[How to get your deposit back ➞](/guides/mietkaution#how-to-get-your-kaution-back)**

## How to avoid scams

### When you look for apartments

If you can't visit the apartment, it's probably a scam. Use [reverse image search](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0) to see if the photos come from another website. Check if the text was copied from another listing. Check if the apartment has the same windows in the listing and on Google Street View.

Round numbers are suspicious. If the rent is exactly 800€ and the *[[Nebenkosten]]* are exactly 75€, it might be a scam.[^43] *Nebenkosten* are based on usage, so they are rarely a round number.

If the price is too good to be true, it's probably a scam.[^9]

### When you contact the landlord

Signs of a scam:

- The landlord's user account is only a few days old
- The landlord is German, but speaks bad German
- The landlord is from an has an English name, but speaks bad English
- The landlord sends you a scan of their passport[^29]

Google the name, email address and [[IBAN]] of the landlord or *[[Hausverwaltung]]*. Check if they really exist, and if there are warnings about them. Google parts of their message. Check if they used the same message to scam other people.[^10]

You can't meet the landlord, only a friend or a relative. Video calls are not possible.

When you visit the apartment, check if the landlord really owns the apartment.

The names on the email, the doorbell, the mailbox and the website should be the same.[^27] Ask the neighbour who lives there.[^28] When you see the landlord in person, you can ask to see their ID.

Really bad German or English grammar

### When you visit the apartment

Always see the apartment in person. If you are not in Germany, **use a platform with verified landlords** like [Homelike](/out/homelike), [HousingAnywhere](/out/housinganywhere) or [Spotahome](/out/spotahome). They only pay the landlord after you [move in](/guides/moving-in). If the apartment is not as described, you get your money back.

**Don't pay anything** before you see the apartment and sign a lease.

Signs of a scam:

- You can't visit the apartment

### When you apply for the apartment

**Watermark your documents.** Make them unusable by identity thieves. - [Watermark a PDF](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/add-watermark)

**Censor your documents.** Remove bank account numbers, passport numbers and [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer)s from your documents. The safest way to censor a document is to print it, censor it with a pen, and scan it again.

### When you sign the lease

Ask [Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse), a *[[Mieterverein]]* or a lawyer to verify your lease. If your rent is too high, they can help you lower it. Your landlord can't kick you out because you lower your rent.

Red Tape Translation can also check your lease.

**[Where to get legal help ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#apartment-questions)**

Signs of a scam:

- The lease is in English

### When you pay the rent and deposit

In Germany, people pay rent by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). Never send money by Western Union or other payment services.[^8] If you pay with cash, ask for a receipt. Use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money from another country. You have until the day you [move in](/guides/moving-in) to pay the rent and the deposit, so you can also come to Germany, [open a bank account](/guides/german-banks-no-address), then pay your rent.

Germans pay the rent by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung). Bank transfers to other countries are suspicious; the landlord's [[IBAN]] should start with "DE".[^16] It should be the same IBAN as in their *[[Impressum]]*.

Wait before you send money.[^42] You must pay the rent and the 1/3 of the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution) before you [move in](/guides/moving-in). You never have to pay earlier.

Don't pay anything before you see the apartment in person, sign the lease and get the keys.[^7] You have [until the day you move in](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution) to pay the rent and the [deposit](/glossary/Kaution). You can [pay the deposit in 3 instalments](/guides/mietkaution#when-to-pay-the-kaution). You never have to pay a fee to see an apartment, or to apply for it.[^11]

**[How to pay the rent and deposit ➞](/guides/moving-in#pay-the-rent)**

Signs of a scam:

- The landlord wants you to pay with cash, Paypal, Western Union, MoneyGram or cryptocurrencies.
- The landlord wants you to pay on a different platform.
- The landlord wants you to pay sooner
- The landlord's bank is in another country. The [[IBAN]] does not start with "DE".

### When you move in

Take a lot of pictures.

You can also [report scams to the police](https://www.bka.de/DE/KontaktAufnehmen/Onlinewachen/onlinewachen_node.html).
