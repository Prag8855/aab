## Renting vs. buying in Germany

Don't buy something unless you will stay there 5 to 10 years.

Pros:

- You can't get evicted
- Your rent won't go up

Cons:

- Huge initial investment
- Unexpected expenses
- Less flexibility to move


## How much does it cost to own a house?

### Buying the house

When you buy a house, you must also pay various fees (*Kaufnebenkosten*):

- Real estate agent (*Makler*) fees - up to 7.14% of the purchase price[^8]
- Property transfer tax ([*Grunderwerbssteuer*](/glossary/Grunderwerbsteuer)) - 3.5% to 6.5% of the purchase price[^8]
- Land registry transfer (*Grundbucheintrag*) - 2% of the purchase price
- Notary fees - 2% of the purchase price[^0]

In total, expect to pay around 12% of the house price in fees[^1]. This money is gone. If you sell the house, you will not get that money back.

### Owning the house

Your mortgage (*Hypothek*) is not the only thing you must pay. You will always need to pay maintenance costs (*Betriebskosten*). This includes:

- **Mortgage payments**  
    You choose how fast you repay your mortgage, and how much you want to pay every month. A part of your monthly payment is the interest for your mortgage. That money goes to the bank.
- **Trash collection** (*Müllabfuhr*)  
    350€ per year, on average[^2]
- **Water and sewer usage** (*Wasserkosten* and *Abwasserkosten*)  
    600€ per year for 2 people, on average[^3]. 1200€ for 4 people, on average[^4]. It depends on how much water you use.
- **Electricity and gas bills** (*[[Nebenkosten]]*)
- **Property tax** (*Grundsteuer*)  
    The property tax is 0.26% to 1% of the value of the property, every year.
- **Insurance**
    - (*Gebäudeversicherung*)
    - (*Elementarversicherung*)
    - **Household insurance** (*[[Hausratversicherung]]*)  
        Around 200€ per year. This is optional. It insures the items in your house.
- **Maintenance and repairs** (*Instandhaltungskosten*)  
    If you rent an apartment, you must contribute to an Instandhaltungsrücklage ... 40 to 200 per month[?](https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/ersijp/mieten_oder_kaufen/ff7asyy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ... [https://www.wuestenrot.de/de/i...  ](https://www.wuestenrot.de/de/ihr_wohnwunsch/modernisieren/instandhaltungsruecklage.html)
- Chimney sweep (*Schornsteinfeger*)

The amounts used above are for Berlin. The prices vary a lot between cities.

You also need to do all the maintenance around the house. The cost of maintenance averages 2% of the cost of the house (excluding the land) per year. If you have a 300 000€ house, you will spend around 6000€ a year in upkeep (really?).

It's also your responsibility to remove snow from the sidewalk.

For the first few decades after new houses are built, the owners are liable to pay for building/maintaining the streets around the house. The city can decide to repair the street just before this period ends. It's a very expensive, very sudden cost. It can be well over 10000€[^9].

## How much can I afford?

You should normally spend less than 1/3 of your income on housing (including maintenance and *Nebenkosten*). Not everyone follows that rule.

"Everyone wants to sell you a bigger house, and a bigger mortgage, because they make a bigger commission", right?

Minimum down payment? 10 to 25%?

## Is German real estate a good investment?

Not really. Buying a house is *sometimes* a good investment, but not always.

### Buying an apartment for yourself

See the ["renting vs buying"](/guides/buying-a-house#renting-vs-buying-in-germany) section.

### Buying an apartment to rent it

If you buy an apartment to rent it, you probably won't make a lot of money. The annual returns on real estate are very low[^5]. 50% of landlords earn less than 2% per year. 8.5% of landlords lose money. Only 18% of landlords earn more than 5%. This is very low compared to other forms of investment.

You must also pay [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) on your rental income, but [some expenses](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/a7enb2/how_much_tax_does_a_landlord_have_to_pay_annually/) are tax-deductible[^6].

Being a landlord is also a lot of work[^6]:

- You must find and verify tenants. In Germany, the law favours tenants. It can take months to evict a bad tenant, even if they decide to stop paying rent.
- You must maintain the apartment and repair things when they break. You must find reliable workers to do the repairs. This can take months. During that time, your tenants can ask for a reduced rent.
- There is a lot of paperwork to do. There is paperwork when the tenants move in, and when they move out. Tax returns are more complicated.

You must find and vet tenants, do a lot of paperwork when they move in and out, maintain the apartment, to doing the accounts for what they've paid and what they owe, to doing your annual tax return (which suddenly becomes a whole lot more complicated). And all this assumes you have "nice" tenants - if a tenant decides to be awkward, then your workload just went up severalfold, between researching the law, speaking to lawyers, etc. Don't expect to just rent out an apartment and have the money roll in every month.

### Buying an apartment to resell it

House flipping is not common in Germany, because the taxes and fees are too high. If you resell a house within 10 years, you will pay a 25% speculation tax (*Spekulationssteuer*) on the profit[^7]. If you live in that house, you only pay the *Spekulationssteuer* if you resell in the first 2 years.

## How does it compare to other countries?

- City restrictions, taxes and responsibilities
- HoAs and relationship with neighbours

## The down payment

In Germany, the down payment for a house is 10 to 20% of the cost of the property[^10].

## The mortgage

Mortgages (*Hypothek*) in Germany are simple.

The interest rate is fixed for 5 to 20 years. If the rate is fixed for a long period, the interest rate is higher. Every 5 to 20 years, you must renegotiate your interest rate. You can also "lock" your interest rate with a *Bausparvertrag*.

The repayment rate is normally 2% per year, but you can adjust it.

If you pay your mortgage back too fast, there is a penalty.

Some mortgages have a *Sondertilgung*. Once a year, it lets you make an extra mortgage payment. If you have extra money one year, you can repay your mortgage a bit faster. The maximum payment is usually around 5% of your total mortgage.

When you look for a mortgage, you need to do a lot of shopping. You will get very different offers. Picking the right mortgage will save you a lot of money.

Building your own house

Do you need to be a German resident/citizen?

No[^11]. It might be more difficult to get money from the bank. The interest rate could be higher?
