German jobs have a notice period (*Kündigungsfrist*). If you quit or get laid off, you must work until the end of your notice period. This guide explains how that notice period works.

## If you quit your job

The default notice period is 4 weeks, rounded up to the 15th or last day of the month.[^2] Your notice period starts one day after your employer receives your [resignation letter](/glossary/Kündigungsschreiben).[^5]

> **Example 1:** You give your [resignation letter](/glossary/Kündigungsschreiben) on May 18. Your notice period starts on May 19. You must work until June 30. That's 4 weeks later (June 16), rounded to up the last day of the month (June 30).

> **Example 2:** Your notice period starts on May 12. You must work until June 15. That's 4 weeks later (June 9), rounded to up the 15th day of the month (June 15).

**Check your work contract**. Many jobs have a longer notice period. A 3 month notice period is common.[^13] Some jobs have 6 month or 1 year notice periods.

> **Example 3:** Your work contract has a 3 month notice period. You give your resignation letter on July 10. Your notice period starts on July 11. You must work until October 11. That's 3 months later.

If your company has a collective agreement (*Tarifvertrag*), you might have a different notice period. It might replace the notice period in your work contract.[^14]

**During your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit)**, your notice period is only 2 weeks.[^1]

> **Example:** You started a job 2 months ago, and you are still in your probation period. You resign on July 11. You must work until July 25. That's 2 weeks later.

## If you get laid off or fired

If you get laid off, the default notice period depends on how long you have worked for this employer:[^3]

| Time with this employer | Notice period |

---|
| Still in [probation](/glossary/Probezeit) | 2 weeks |
| Under 2 years | 4 weeks, on the 15th or last day of the month |
| Over 2 years | 1 month, on the last day of the month |
| Over 5 years | 2 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 8 years | 3 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 10 years | 4 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 12 years | 5 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 15 years | 6 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 20 years | 7 months, on the last day of the month |

> **Example 1:** You work for a company for 1 year. You get laid off on February 18. You must work until March 31. That's 1 month later (March 18), rounded to the last day of the month (March 31).

> **Example 2:** You started a job 2 months ago, and you are still in your probation period. You get laid off on July 11. You must work until July 25. That's 2 weeks later.

**Check your work contract**. Many jobs have a longer notice period. A 3 month notice period is common.[^13] Some jobs have 6 month or 1 year notice periods. The notice period for your employer (if laid off) can't be shorter than your notice period (if you quit).[^12]

If your company has a collective agreement (*Tarifvertrag*), you might have a different notice period. It might replace the notice period in your work contract.[^14]

> **Example 3:** Your work contract has a 3 month notice period. You get laid off on July 10. Your notice period starts on July 11. Your employer must pay you until October 11. That's 3 months later.

Your notice period starts one day after you receive your termination letter.

### If you get fired

If you get fired for a serious reason, there is no notice period. For example, if you steal money, refuse to work, or threaten other workers, or make racist comments in public, there is no notice period.[^9] In most cases, you get a written warning first.

### Before your first day of work

If you quit or lose your job before you start working, the notice period is 2 weeks. If this happens at least 2 weeks before your start date, you don't go to work, and you don't get paid. Your work contract can have special rules for this.[^11]

If you relocated for work, you can sue your employer. You can ask for compensation for the money that you lost.[^10] [Talk to a lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) first.

### When your employer goes bankrupt

If your employer goes bankrupt, the notice period is limited to 3 months, at the end of the month.[^4]

Your employer can also put you on *Kurzarbeit*. They reduce your work hours, and they must pay your salary in advance. This can happen when your employer has serious financial problems.

## How the notice period works

During your notice period, your employer still pays your salary, health insurance, pension insurance and other benefits.[^8] You can still take [sick days](/guides/sick-leave) and [use your vacation days](/guides/vacation-days). You still get paid time off for [public holidays](/guides/public-holidays).

During your notice period, your employer can make you work, or send you on [garden leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_leave) (*bezahlte Freistellung*). Garden leave means that you don't go to work work, but you still get paid.[^6] When you are on garden leave, your employer can still call you back to work.[^7]

**If you want to leave sooner**, you can negotiate a shorter notice period with your employer. Your employer can refuse to shorten your notice period.[^15] To shorten your notice period, you must sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag*. If you choose a shorter notice period, you usually lose 3 months of [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).[^16]

### Unused vacation days

If you have unused vacation days, your employer can force you to use them. You can also transfer unused vacation days to your next employer with an *[[Urlaubsbescheinigung]]*.

If you still have unused vacation day when your employment ends, your employer must pay you for them.[^17]
