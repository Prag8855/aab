In Germany, all jobs have a notice period (*Kündigungsfrist*), both for the employee (when they quit) and the employer (when they fire someone). This guide explains how notice periods work.

Before you [find a new job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), check your notice period in your work contract. Many jobs have a 3 month notice period.[^13] If your work contract does not have a notice period, the default notice period applies.

## If you quit your job

When you quit, the default notice period is 4 weeks, rounded to the 15th or last day of the month.[^2]

> **Example 1:** Your work contract has a 3 month notice period. You quit your job on January 5. You must work until March 5.

> **Example 1:** Your work contract does not mention a notice period.

> **Example 2:** Your work contract does not mention a notice period.

## If you get laid off

If you get laid off, the default notice period depends on how long you have worked for this employer:[^3]

| Time with this employer | Notice period |
|---|---|
| Still in [probation](/glossary/Probezeit) | 2 weeks |
| Under 2 years | 4 weeks, on the 15th or last day of the month |
| Over 2 years | 1 month, on the last day of the month |
| Over 5 years | 2 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 8 years | 3 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 10 years | 4 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 12 years | 5 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 15 years | 6 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 20 years | 7 months, on the last day of the month |

> **Example 1:** You work for a company for 1 year. You get laid off on February 18. You must work until March 31.

> **Example 2:** You get laid off on March 17. You must work and get paid until May 31.

### In case of bankruptcy

If your employer goes bankrupt, the notice period is limited to 3 months, at the end of the month.[^4]

## If you get fired

If you get fired, the notice period depends on why you were fired.

When the reasons are serious, there is no notice period. For example, if you steal money, refuse to work, or threaten other workers, or make racist comments in public, there is no notice period.[^9]

## How the notice period works

Your notice period starts on the day after your employer receives your resignation letter.[^5]

During your notice period, your employer still pays your salary, health insurance, pension insurance and other benefits.[^8] You can still take [sick days](/guides/sick-leave) and [use your vacation days](/guides/vacation-days).

During your notice period, your employer can make you work, or send you on [garden leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_leave) (*bezahlte Freistellung*). Garden leave means that you don't go to work work, but you still get paid.[^6] When you are on garden leave, your employer can still call you back to work.[^7]

If you want to leave sooner, you can negotiate a shorter notice period with your employer.
