Tax advisors (*Steuerberater*) help you with your personal and business taxes. A tax advisor can:

- Help you understand your taxes
- File your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung)
- Help you [start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)
- Prepare documents to [renew your freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)
- Take care of your business taxes ([VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer), *[[Gewerbesteuer]]*, ...)

Tax advisors are legally liable for the advice they give. If they make a mistake, they pay for it.

## When to hire a tax advisor

Hire a tax advisor when...

- **You have a complicated tax situation**  
    For example, you have income from multiple countries, income from multiple sources, or problems that tax software can't solve.
- **You want someone to take care of everything**  
    They can talk with the *[[Finanzamt]]*, and do all your taxes for you. You don't have to do anything. This makes your life much easier.
- **You are [starting a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**  
    A tax advisor can [register your business](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung), explain how business taxes work, and help you avoid expensive mistakes. They must also stamp documents for your [freelance visa application](/guides/freelance-visa) and [renewal](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa). When you understand how to run your business, you can use [tax software for freelancers](/guides/german-tax-software#tax-software-for-freelancers) instead.
- **You must [renew a freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)**  
    A tax advisor must prepare and stamp some of the required documents. You can't renew your freelance visa without one.
- **You are in trouble**  
    If you have problems with the *[[Finanzamt]]*, and you don't know what to do. They can take care of all communications with the *Finanzamt*. They can quickly solve your problem.

If you have a simple tax situation, you don't need a tax advisor. The *[[Finanzamt]]* already knows how much you earned from your job. You might not need to make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). Just use [[ELSTER]] or [tax software](/guides/german-tax-software) to declare [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expenses.

## Cost of a tax advisor

**If you are an employee**, you pay 300€ to 1,000€ for a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung).[^1] The prices vary a lot. Use [this calculator](https://www.steuerschroeder.de/Steuerberatergebuehren.html) to estimate the costs.

**If you are self-employed**, you must pay more. If you don't charge [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer), it costs 300€ to 800€ per year. If you charge VAT, it costs 700€ to 2,000€ per year. The prices vary a lot. The only way to know is to call and ask.

The cost of a tax advisor is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^0]

## Alternatives to a tax advisor

Tax advisors are expensive and hard to find.[^5] Most of them refuse new clients. There are other ways to do your taxes in Germany.

### Look outside of Berlin

Your tax advisor can be anywhere in Germany. It's easier if you look in other German cities.

### Tax software

If your tax situation is simple, use tax software. For example, if you have a full time job and no [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expenses.

Using tax software cheaper and easier than finding a tax advisor. There are English-speaking options.

**[List of German tax software ➞](/guides/german-tax-software)**

### Buchhalter

**Bookkeepers** (*[[Buchhalter]]*) are cheaper than tax advisors, because they are not certified professionals. Anyone can be a *Buchhalter*.

They can help you file your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung), but you must verify their work, and submit the tax declaration yourself. If they make a mistake, it's your problem.

**[Steuerberater or Buchhalter? ➞](/guides/steuerberater-vs-buchhalter)**

### Lohnsteuerhilfeverein

A tax help union (*[[Lohnsteuerhilfeverein]]*) is a non-profit organisation that helps its members file their taxes. They are cheaper than tax advisors, but their competence varies a lot.[^2]

The membership costs 30€ to 300€ per year, depending on your income.[^4] Only employees can be members, not self-employed people.[^3]

### Freelancer cooperative

**[Smart](/out/smart-coop)** is a cooperative for freelancers. If you are a member, they take care of invoicing, taxes, and many other things for you. They also give you an employment contract and a steady income. 

If you want the flexibility of a freelancer and the stability of a job, it's a good option.
