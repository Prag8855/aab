The German tax system is complicated. A tax advisor can take care of your taxes. If you are an employee, they can prepare your tax declaration and deduct expenses. If you want to [start a business in Germany](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany), they will take care of the business registration and verify all your finances. They are worth the cost.

## Steuerberater or Buchhalter?

Should you hire a tax advisor (*[[Steuerberater]]*) or a bookkeeper (*[[Buchhalter]]*)? Tax advisors are allowed to submit tax declarations and financial statements in your name. Bookkeepers can fill the papers, but you must submit them yourself. If a *Steuerberater* makes a mistake, they are legally liable. If a *Buchhalter* makes a mistake, it's your problem.

**Related guide:** [Steuerberater or Buchhalter: what's the difference?](/guides/steuerberater-vs-buchhalter)

## How much does a Steuerberater cost?

**If you are an employee**, it depends on your income. You will pay 300€ to 1,000€ for a tax declaration. The prices vary a lot. The best way to know is to call and ask them how much they charge. Use [this calculator](https://www.steuerschroeder.de/Steuerberatergebuehren.html) to estimate the costs.

**If you are self-employed**, you must pay more. If you don't charge [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer), you should pay 300€ to 800€ per year. If you charge VAT, you should pay 700€ to 2,000€ per year. The prices vary a lot. The best way to know is to call and ask.

Tax advisor fees are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^0]

## English-language tax software for Germany

Tax advisors are very expensive. If you want to save money, you can use tax software instead.

**If you are an employee**, you can use [Taxfix](/out/taxfix) or [SteuerGo](/out/steuergo). Both are available in English. They help you enter expenses and file tax declarations.

**If you are self-employed**, you can use [Accountable](/out/accountable) or [Sorted](/out/sorted-taxes). Both are in English. They help you with invoicing and [VAT reporting](/glossary/Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung). Some banks like [Kontist](/out/kontist), [Holvi](/out/holvi) and [Qonto](/out/qonto) can also make your accounting easier. Personally, I use [Lexoffice](/out/lexoffice), but it's only in German.

If you don't know what you are doing, you can still make very expensive mistakes. A tax advisor is better, but it's more expensive. I have tried all options, and a tax advisor is still the best option.

Tax and bookkeeping software costs are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^0]
