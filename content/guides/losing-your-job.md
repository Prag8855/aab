??what if you get laid off or fired??

### Notice period

All German jobs have a notice period (*Kündigungsfrist*). You can't quit your job without a warning, and your employer can't lay you off without a warning.

Before you [find a new job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), check your notice period in your work contract. Many jobs have a 3 month notice period.[^13] If your work contract does not have a notice period, the default notice period applies.

**If you quit**, the default notice period is 4 weeks, rounded to the 15th or last day of the month.[^2]

> **Example 1:** Your work contract has a 3 month notice period. You quit your job on January 5. You must work until March 5.

> **Example 1:** Your work contract does not mention a notice period.

> **Example 2:** Your work contract does not mention a notice period.

**If you get laid off**, the default notice period depends on how long you have worked for this employer:[^3]

| Time with this employer | Notice period |
|---|---|
| Still in [probation](/glossary/Probezeit) | 2 weeks |
| Under 2 years | 4 weeks, on the 15th or last day of the month |
| Over 2 years | 1 month, on the last day of the month |
| Over 5 years | 2 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 8 years | 3 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 10 years | 4 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 12 years | 5 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 15 years | 6 months, on the last day of the month |
| Over 20 years | 7 months, on the last day of the month |

> **Example 1:** You work for a company for 1 year. You get laid off on February 18. You must work until March 31.

> **Example 2:** You get laid off on March 17. You must work and get paid until May 31.

If your employer goes bankrupt, the notice period is limited to 3 months, at the end of the month.[^4]

Your notice period starts on the day after your employer receives your resignation letter.[^5]

During your notice period, your employer still pays your salary, health insurance, pension insurance and other benefits.[^8]

During your notice period, your employer can make you work, or send you on [garden leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_leave) (*bezahlte Freistellung*). Garden leave means that you don't go to work work, but you still get paid.[^6] When you are on garden leave, your employer can still call you back to work.[^7]

If you want to leave sooner, you can negotiate a shorter notice period with your employer.

**If you were fired**, the notice period depends on why you were fired.

For example, if you steal money, refuse to work, or threaten other workers, or make racist comments in public, there is no notice period.[^9]

??? Vacations and notice period ???

What happens to bonuses? Paycheques? Taxes?

The same vacation day rules apply.

### What happens to your residence permit

Most resident permits are tied to your job. If you lose your job, you lose your residence permit.

If you are a German permanent resident or a EU/EEA citizen, you can stay in Germany. You don't need to do anything. ??right??

### What happens to your health insurance

When you stop working, you keep your health insurance. Your health insurance coverage does not change.

If you get unemployment benefits, the state pays for your health insurance.

If you don't get unemployment benefits, you must pay for health insurance yourself. Use the health insurance calculator to see the cost.
