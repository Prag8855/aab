## Before you leave your job

### Calculate your notice period

In Germany, all jobs have a notice period (*[[Kündigungsfrist]]*). You can't quit your job without a warning, and your employer can't lay you off without a warning.

The notice period can be very long. You can negotiate a shorter period with your employer.

**[How the notice period works ➞](/guides/job-notice-period)**

### Give your resignation letter

If you quit your job, you must give a resignation letter (*[[Kündigungsschreiben]]*). Your resignation is only valid when your employer receives your letter.

**[How to write and send a resignation letter ➞](/guides/german-resignation-letter)**

If you get fired or laid off, your employer must give you a resignation letter.

### Resist your dismissal

**If you get fired or laid off**, and you think your employer is wrong, you have 3 weeks to resist. You must file a *Kündigungsschutzklage*.

During your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), your employer can fire you without a reason. After your probation period, your employer must give a valid reason.

Your employer can offer you a severance pay (*Abfindung*) to encourage you to leave. Severance pay in Germany is lower than in North America. You can hire a labour lawyer to negotiate better severance pay.

If you agree and sign a termination agreement (*Aufhebungsvertrag*), you can't resist your dismissal.

https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kschg/__4.html

### Don't sign anything

Your employer can suggest a termination agreement (*Aufhebungsvertrag*). If you sign one, you don't get fired; you agree to leave your job. **This is often a bad idea**.

When you sign a termination agreement...[^19]

- **You lose dismissal protection** (*Kündigungsschutz*)  
    You can't sue your employer for unlawful dismissal, because you agreed to leave your job. Employers often suggest an *Aufhebungsvertrag* when they have no valid reason to fire you.
- **There is no minimum [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist)**  
    You can agree to leave your job sooner. This is good if you want to start another job soon. It's bad if you need more time.
- **You can lose 3 months of [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)**  
    In some cases, you can lose 3 months of *[[ALG I]]*.[^24] It depends on how your *Aufhebungsvertrag* is phrased. See [how unemployment benefits work](/guides/unemployment-benefits).
- **You can get better severance pay** (*Abfindung*)  
    You can get more severance pay than the legal minimum: 2 weeks of pay for every year with your employer.[^21]

In other words, when you sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag*, you make a deal with your employer. Only sign it if it's a good deal. Your employer can't force you to sign it.[^20] If you are not sure, [get legal help](#need-help).

### Negotiate severance pay

If you get laid off, ask for severance pay (*Abfindung*). You must negotiate the exact amount. In some cases, the legal minimum is 2 weeks of pay for every year with your employer.[^21] You can ask for much more.[^26]

You can negotiate more. Your employer usually offers you severance pay if you sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag*. You get paid to leave without making trouble.

Your severance pay can affect your unemployment benefits. If it's really high, you can lose 3 months of unemployment benefits.[^25] You also pay for your health insurance during that time.[^8]

[Conny](/out/conny-abfindung) can help you negotiate a higher severance pay. They speak English.

### Get a letter of reference

Ask your employer for a letter of reference (*[[Arbeitszeugnis]]*). You can ask for it in your [resignation letter](/glossary/Kündigungsschreiben). Your employer can't refuse provide a letter of reference.[^15]

If you are an [[Azubi]], a working student, a temporary worker or a [minijobber](/glossary/Minijob), you also have the right to get a letter of reference.

The letter of reference must clearly explain the type of work you did, and the for how long. Your employer must give you a paper version, not an electronic version. It must not have information about your health, your salary, your other jobs, your union membership, or your political affiliations. Your employer needs your explicit permission to mention why you quit or got fired.[^16]

If you worked for more than 6 weeks, you can ask for a qualified reference (*qualifiziertes Arbeitszeugnis*). This version also includes an evaluation of your performance, and the reason you left the company.

### Register as a job seeker

Register as a job seeker at the *[Agentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit)*. You can register as a job seeker [online](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/arbeitslos-melden/), [by phone](tel:+498004555500) or in person at a *Jobcenter*. You must do this **at least 3 months before your last day of work**.

**[How to register as a job seeker ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits#register-as-a-job-seeker)**

### Tell the Ausländerbehörde

If you have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) like a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], you must tell the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* that you will be unemployed. Do this as soon as know that you will be unemployed. Do not wait more than 2 weeks.[^11]

To inform the *Ausländerbehörde*, you must...

1. [Choose the right department to email](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)
2. Write an email in German. It must include:
    - [ ] Your full name
    - [ ] Your date and place of birth
    - [ ] Your nationality
    - [ ] What kind of residence permit you have
    - [ ] When your employment ends
3. Attach these documents to your email:[^2]
    - [ ] A copy of your termination notice or resignation letter
4. Send your email. You will not get a confirmation. They might not reply.[^3]

You don't need to inform the *Ausländerbehörde* if...[^4]

- You had this work visa or Blue Card for more than 2 years
- **or** you had a valid residence permit for the last 3 years, excluding the [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa)
- **or** you have [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)
- **or** you have EU citizenship

### Tell your health insurance

When you lose your job, you keep your health insurance. The coverage does not change. Only the price can change.[^6]

## After you leave your job

### Register as unemployed

You must register as unemployed at the *[Agentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit)*. You can do this [online](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/arbeitslos-melden/), [by phone](tel:+498004555500) or in person at the *Jobcenter*. You can do this up to 3 months before your last day of work. You must do it **before your second day of unemployment**.

**[Register as unemployed](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/arbeitslos-melden/)** - Agentur für Arbeit

### Make a tax declaration

At the end of the year, make a tax declaration (*[[Steuererklärung]]*)

If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), you *must* do it.

If you don't get unemployment benefits, you should still make a tax declaration. When you are employed, you pay salary tax (*[[Lohnsteuer]]*). Salary tax is based on your predicted income. If you did not work for a few months, your predicted income was too high, and you paid too much taxes. Make a tax declaration, and you will get money back.

Your job search expenses are also [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). - [More information](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-7-make-a-tax-declaration).

## What happens to your residence permit

### Work visa or Blue Card

After you email the *Ausländerbehörde*, nothing happens. Your residence permit stays valid, and you can stay in Germany.[^12] The *Ausländerbehörde* will give you 6 months to find another job.[^5]

If you had your residence permit for at least 2 years, you can start a new job. You don't need to ask the Ausländerbehörde for a new residence permit; just tell them that you have a new job, and include a copy of your new work contract.

If you had your residence permit for less than 2 years, you apply for a new residence permit to start a new job. This can take a few months.

**[How to apply for a work visa or Blue Card ➞](/guides/german-work-visa)**

### Citizens and permanent residents

If you lose your job, nothing happens. EU citizens and German permanent residents can live in Germany without a job.

## What happens to your health insurance

Your health insurance stays the same, but the price can change.

### With public health insurance

Your [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) becomes cheaper. Sometimes, it becomes free.

**If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)**, the *[Agentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit)* pays for your health insurance.[^17]

**If you don't get unemployment benefits**, you must pay around around {{GKV_ESTIMATED_MIN_CONTRIBUTION|cur}}€ per month. Your spouse's or your parents' public health insurance can cover you for free (*[[Familienversicherung]]*).[^7]

In some cases, your health insurance is free for 1 month after you lose your job (*nachgehende Leistungsanspruch*).[^18] This happens automatically; you don't need to apply for it.

### With private health insurance

Your [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) becomes twice as expensive, or you get free public health insurance.

- **If you get unemployment benefits**
    You must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). The *[Agentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit)* pays for your health insurance.[^1] In some cases, you can keep your private health insurance.[^2]
- **If you don't get unemployment benefits**
    You keep your private health insurance.[^3] The price stays the same, but your employer does not pay half of it. For example, if your private health insurance costs 500€ per month, your employer paid 250€, and you paid 250€. If you lose your job, you pay 500€.

**[Who gets unemployment benefits? ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits#who-gets-unemployment-benefits)**

## What happens to your pay and bonuses

Your employer must pay you until the end of your [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist). They must pay your full salary, even if they don't make you work.[^23] If you sign a termination agreement (*Aufhebungsvertrag*), you can have a shorter notice period.

When your job ends, you stop getting paid. You might get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I). This gives you financial support while you [find another job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

**[How unemployment benefits work ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits)**

If you get a yearly performance bonus, your employer must pay that bonus even if you leave the company.[^22] The bonus can be prorated. For example, if you should get a performance bonus every year, but you quit in September, you should get 75% of the promised bonus. If you don't get your bonus, [talk to a lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin).

## What happens to your unused vacation days

You normally use your last vacation days during your [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist).[^14]

Request an *[[Urlaubsbescheinigung]]* from your employer.

The same vacation day rules apply. You can still go on sick leave.
