This guide shows you what to do when:

It only applies to employees, not freelancers.

## Quitting your job

### Calculate your notice period

In Germany, all jobs have a notice period (*[[Kündigungsfrist]]*). You can't quit your job without a warning, and your employer can't lay you off without a warning.

The notice period can be very long. You can negotiate a shorter period with your employer.

If you get fired for misconduct, there is usually no notice period.

**[How the notice period works ➞](/guides/job-notice-period)**

### Give your resignation letter

To quit your job, you must give a resignation letter (*[[Kündigungsschreiben]]*). Your resignation is only valid when your employer receives your letter.

**[How to write and send a resignation letter ➞](/guides/german-resignation-letter)**

If you get fired or laid off, your employer must give you a resignation letter. If you did not choose to leave, don't give a resignation letter.

## Getting fired or laid off

### Resist your dismissal

If you get fired or laid off, you have 3 weeks to resist.[^30] You must file a *Kündigungsschutzklage*.

During your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), your employer can fire you without a reason. After your probation period, your employer must give a valid reason.

Your employer can offer you a severance pay (*Abfindung*) to encourage you to leave. Severance pay in Germany is lower than in North America. A labour lawyer can help you negotiate better severance pay.

If you are over 50 years old and plan to retire soon, you can ask for [pension payments instead of severance pay](https://vangard.de/en/news-analysis/blog/pension-contributions-instead-of-severance-pay).

### Do not sign an Aufhebungsvertrag

Your employer can suggest a termination agreement (*Aufhebungsvertrag*). If you sign one, you don't get fired; you agree to leave your job. This can be a bad idea.

When you sign a termination agreement...[^19]

- **You lose dismissal protection** (*Kündigungsschutz*)  
    You can't sue your employer for unlawful dismissal, because you agreed to leave your job. Employers often suggest an *Aufhebungsvertrag* when they have no valid reason to fire you.
- **There is no minimum [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist)**  
    You can agree to leave your job sooner. This is good if you want to start another job soon. It's bad if you need more time to find another job.
- **You can lose 3 months of [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)**  
    In some cases, you can lose 3 months of *[[ALG I]]*.[^24] It depends on how your *Aufhebungsvertrag* is phrased. See [how unemployment benefits work](/guides/unemployment-benefits).
- **You can get better severance pay** (*Abfindung*)  
    You can get more severance pay than the legal minimum: 2 weeks of pay for every year with your employer.[^21]

In other words, when you sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag*, you make a deal with your employer. Only sign it if it's a good deal. Your employer can't force you to sign it.[^20] If you are not sure, [get legal help](#need-help).

### Negotiate severance pay

If you get laid off, ask for severance pay (*Abfindung*). You must negotiate the exact amount. In some cases, the legal minimum is 2 weeks of pay for every year with your employer.[^21] You can ask for much more.[^26]

You can negotiate more. Your employer usually offers you severance pay if you sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag*. You get paid to leave without making trouble.

Your severance pay can affect your unemployment benefits. If it's really high, you can lose 3 months of unemployment benefits.[^25] You also pay for your health insurance during that time.[^8]

[Conny](/out/conny-abfindung) can help you negotiate a higher severance pay. They speak English.

### Register as a job seeker

When you know that you will be unemployed, register as a job seeker at the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]*. Do this as soon as you can. If you are late, you get less [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).

**[How to register as a job seeker ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits#register-as-a-job-seeker)**

### Register as unemployed

When you know your last day of work, register as unemployed at the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]*. This is how you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I). Do it in your last 3 months of work.

**[How to register as unemployed ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits#register-as-unemployed)**

### Tell the Ausländerbehörde

If you have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) like a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], you must tell the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* that you will be unemployed. Do this as soon as know that you will be unemployed. Do not wait more than 2 weeks.[^11]

To inform the *Ausländerbehörde*, you must...

1. [Choose the right department to email](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)
2. Write an email in German. It must include:
    - [ ] Your full name
    - [ ] Your date and place of birth
    - [ ] Your nationality
    - [ ] What kind of residence permit you have
    - [ ] When your employment ends
3. Attach these documents to your email:[^2]
    - [ ] A copy of your termination notice or resignation letter
4. Send your email. You will not get a confirmation. They might not reply.[^3]

You don't need to inform the *Ausländerbehörde* if...[^4]

- You had this work visa or Blue Card for more than 2 years
- **or** you had a valid residence permit for the last 3 years, excluding the [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa)
- **or** you have [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)
- **or** you have EU citizenship

**[What happens to your residence permit ↓](#what-happens-to-your-residence-permit)**

### Tell your health insurance

When you lose your job, you keep your health insurance. The coverage does not change. Only the price can change.[^6] If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), you might need to switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).

**[What happens to your health insurance ↓](#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance)**

### Get a letter of reference

A letter of reference (*[[Arbeitszeugnis]]*) is a proof of the work you did for your employer. It can help your [job search](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin). Your next employer can ask for it.[^31] Ask for it in your [resignation letter](/glossary/Kündigungsschreiben).

Your employer is required to give you a letter of reference.[^15] Apprentices, working students, temporary workers and [minijobbers](/glossary/Minijob) can also demand a letter of reference.

The letter must clearly explain the type of work you did, and for how long. Your employer must give you a paper version, not an electronic version. It must not have information about your health, your salary, your other jobs, your union membership, or your political affiliations. Your employer needs your explicit permission to mention why you quit or got fired.[^16]

If you worked for more than 6 weeks, you can demand a qualified reference (*qualifiziertes Arbeitszeugnis*). It includes an evaluation of your performance, and the reason you left the company.

### Get an Arbeitsbescheinigung

You need an *[[Arbeitsbescheinigung]]* to get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).[^12] Your employer must send it to the *Agentur für Arbeit* directly.[^13]

If your employer refuses to send your *Arbeitsbescheinigung*, tell your case worker at the *Agentur für Arbeit*. They will pressure your employer, and can fine them up to 2,000€.[^28] This can take a few weeks.

If you can't wait for your *Arbeitsbescheinigung*, ask the *Agentur für Arbeit* for a preliminary approval of your employment benefits (*vorläufige Bewilligung*).[^29] You will get unemployment benefits faster. Use the template at the end of [this document](https://www.rechtsanwalt-koeper.de/workspace/uploads/downloads/vorschussantrag-arbeitslosengeld_1.pdf).

### Get an Urlaubsbescheinigung

A vacation certificate (*[[Urlaubsbescheinigung]]*) shows how many unused vacation days you have. It tells your next employer how many vacation days to give you.[^34]

Your employer is required to give you an *Urlaubsbescheinigung*, but you must ask for it.[^33] Ask for it in your [resignation letter](/glossary/Kündigungsschreiben).

**[What happens to your vacation days ↓](#what-happens-to-your-vacation-days)**

### Other documents

If you work in gastronomy, ask for your *Gesundheitszeugnis*.[^32]

## What happens to your residence permit

### Work visa or Blue Card

After you email the *Ausländerbehörde*, nothing happens. **Your residence permit does not expire**, but it can be shortened. The *Ausländerbehörde* will give you 6 months to find another job.[^5]

If you had your residence permit for at least 2 years, you can start a new job. You don't need to ask the Ausländerbehörde for a new residence permit; just tell them that you have a new job, and include a copy of your new work contract.

If you had your residence permit for less than 2 years, you apply for a new residence permit to start a new job. This can take a few months.

**[How to apply for a work visa or Blue Card ➞](/guides/german-work-visa)**

### Citizens and permanent residents

If you lose your job, nothing happens. EU citizens and German permanent residents can live in Germany without a job.

## What happens to your health insurance

Your health insurance stays the same, but the price can change.

### With public health insurance

Your [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) becomes cheaper. Sometimes, it becomes free.

**If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I)**, the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* pays for your health insurance.[^17]

**If you don't get unemployment benefits**, you must pay around around {{GKV_ESTIMATED_MIN_CONTRIBUTION|cur}}€ per month. Your spouse's or your parents' public health insurance can cover you for free (*[[Familienversicherung]]*).[^7]

In some cases, your health insurance is free for 1 month after you lose your job (*nachgehende Leistungsanspruch*).[^18] This happens automatically; you don't need to apply for it.

### With private health insurance

Your [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) becomes twice as expensive, or you get free public health insurance.

- **If you get unemployment benefits**
    You must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). The *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* pays for your health insurance.[^1] In some cases, you can keep your private health insurance.[^2]
- **If you don't get unemployment benefits**
    You keep your private health insurance.[^3] The price stays the same, but your employer does not pay half of it. For example, if your private health insurance costs 500€ per month, your employer paid 250€, and you paid 250€. If you lose your job, you pay 500€.

**[Who gets unemployment benefits? ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits#who-gets-unemployment-benefits)**

## What happens to your pay and bonuses

Your employer must pay you until the end of your [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist). They must pay your full salary, even if they don't make you work.[^23] If you sign a termination agreement (*Aufhebungsvertrag*), you can have a shorter notice period.

When your job ends, you stop getting paid. You might get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I). This gives you financial support while you [find another job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

**[How unemployment benefits work ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits)**

If you get a yearly performance bonus, your employer must pay that bonus even if you leave the company.[^22] The bonus can be prorated. For example, if you should get a performance bonus every year, but you quit in September, you should get 75% of the promised bonus. If you don't get your bonus, [talk to a lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin).

## What happens to your unused vacation days

You usually take your unused vacation days during your [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist).[^14] If this not possible, your employer must pay you for the unused vacation days.

During your notice period, you can still go on [sick leave](/guides/sick-leave).

**[Vacation days when you change jobs ➞](/guides/vacation-days#if-you-change-jobs)**

## After you leave your job

### Find a new job

**[How to find a job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

You can also start your own business and become self-employed. If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), the *Agentur für Arbeit* helps you with [free training and financial help](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#step-9-get-financial-help).

**[How to start a business ➞](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**

### Make a tax declaration

At the end of the year, make a tax declaration (*[[Steuererklärung]]*). Your job search expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). - [More information](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-7-make-a-tax-declaration).

If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), you *must* make a tax declaration.

If you don't get unemployment benefits, you should still make a tax declaration. When you are employed, you pay salary tax (*[[Lohnsteuer]]*). Salary tax is based on your predicted income. If you did not work for a few months, your predicted income was too high, and you paid too much taxes. Make a tax declaration, and you will get money back.
