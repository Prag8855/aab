## When you get fired

During your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), you can get fired without any reason.

3 weeks to file Kündigungsschutzklage

https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kschg/__4.html

## Before you leave your job

Do these things before your last day of work.

### Send your resignation letter

If you quit your job, you must give a resignation letter (*[[Kündigungsschreiben]]*). Your resignation is only valid when your employer receives that letter.

**[How to write and send a resignation letter ➞](/guides/german-resignation-letter)**

If you get fired or laid off, your employer must give you a resignation letter.

### Give your notice period

In Germany, all jobs have a notice period (*[[Kündigungsfrist]]*). You can't quit your job without a warning, and your employer can't lay you off without a warning. The notice period can be very long.

**[How the notice period works ➞](/guides/job-notice-period)**

### Don't sign everything

Your employer can suggest a termination agreement (*Aufhebungsvertrag*). If you sign one, you don't get fired; you agree to leave your job.

When you sign a termination agreement...[^19]

- **You lose dismissal protection** (*Kündigungsschutz*)  
    You can't sue your employer for unlawful dismissal, because you agreed to leave your job.. Employers often suggest an *Aufhebungsvertrag* when they have no valid reason to fire you.
- **There is no minimum [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist)**  
    You can agree to leave your job sooner. This is good if you want to start another job sooner. It's bad if you need more time.
- **You can lose 3 months of unemployment benefits**
    In some cases, you can lose 3 months of unemployment benefits.[^24] It depends on how your *Aufhebungsvertrag* is phrased.
- **You can get better severance pay** (*Abfindung*)
    You can get more severance pay than the legal minimum: 2 weeks of pay for every year with your employer.[^21]

In other words, when you sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag*, you make a deal with your employer. Only sign it if it's a good deal. Your employer can't force you to sign it.[^20] If you are not sure, [get legal help](#where-to-get-help). 

### Negotiate severance pay

If you get laid off, ask for severance pay (*Abfindung*). You must negotiate the exact amount. In some cases, the legal minimum is 2 weeks of pay for every year with your employer.[^21] You can ask for much more.[^26]

You can negotiate more. Your employer usually offers you severance pay if you sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag*. You get paid to leave without making trouble.

Your severance pay can affect your unemployment benefits. If it's really high, you can lose 3 months of unemployment benefits.[^25]

[Conny](/out/conny-abfindung) can help you negotiate a higher severance pay. They speak English.

### Get a letter of reference

Ask your employer for a letter of reference (*[[Arbeitszeugnis]]*). You can ask for it in your [resignation letter](/glossary/Kündigungsschreiben). Your employer can't refuse provide a letter of reference.[^15]

If you are an [[Azubi]], a working student, a temporary worker or a [minijobber](/glossary/Minijob), you also have the right to get a letter of reference.

The letter of reference must clearly explain the type of work you did, and the for how long. Your employer must give you a paper version, not an electronic version. It must not contain information about your health, your salary, your other jobs, your union membership, or your political affiliations. Your employer needs your explicit permission to mention why you quit or got fired.[^16]

If you worked for more than 6 weeks, you can ask for a qualified reference (*qualifiziertes Arbeitszeugnis*). This version also includes an evaluation of your performance, and the reason you left the company.

### Register as a job seeker

Register as a job seeker at the *[Agentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit)*. You can register as a job seeker [online](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/arbeitslos-melden/), [by phone](tel:+498004555500) or in person at the *Jobcenter*. You must do this **at least 3 months before your last day of work**.

**[How to register as a job seeker ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits#register-as-a-job-seeker)**

### Tell the Ausländerbehörde

If you have a residence permit, you must tell the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* that you are unemployed.

[If you don't need a residence permit](/guides/residence-permit#who-needs-a-German-residence-permit) to work in Germany, you don't need to do this.

**[What happens to your residence permit ↓](#what-happens-to-your-residence-permit)**

### Tell your health insurance

Tell your health insurer that you are unemployed. They will adjust your health insurance payments. You will not lose your health insurance. Your coverage will not change.

**[What happens to your health insurance ↓](#what-happens-to-your-health-insurance)**

## After you leave your job

### Register as unemployed

You must register as unemployed at the *[Agentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit)*. You can do this [online](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/arbeitslos-melden/), [by phone](tel:+498004555500) or in person at the *Jobcenter*. You can do this up to 3 months before your last day of work. You must do it **before your second day of unemployment**.

**[Register as unemployed](https://www.arbeitsagentur.de/arbeitslos-melden/)** - Agentur für Arbeit

### Make a tax declaration

At the end of the year, make a tax declaration (*[[Steuererklärung]]*)

If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), you *must* do it.

If you don't get unemployment benefits, you should still make a tax declaration. When you are employed, you pay salary tax (*[[Lohnsteuer]]*). Salary tax is based on your predicted income. If you did not work for a few months, your predicted income was too high, and you paid too much taxes. Make a tax declaration, and you will get money back.

Your job search expenses are also [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). - [More information](/guides/find-a-job#step-7-make-a-tax-declaration).

### What happens to your residence permit

If you are a German permanent resident or a EU/EEA citizen, you can stay in Germany. You don't need to do anything. ??right??

If you have a residence permit, you must tell the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* that you lost your job.

===

If you need a residence permit to work in Germany, it's probably tied to your employer. If you change jobs, you might need to reapply for a residence permit.

For example, if you work with company A, and you switch to company B, you might need a new residence permit for company B. This can take a few months, and slow down your job change. You might not be able to start working quickly.

If you had a work visa for more than 2 years, you can switch jobs immediately, without waiting for a new residence permit. If you had a Blue Card for X years, it's the same thing.

If you have a youth mobility visa or a X visa, ???

If you need time to find another job, you might need a job seeker visa.

### What happens to your health insurance

When you stop working, you keep your health insurance.

In some cases, your health insurance is free for 1 month after you lose your job (*nachgehende Leistungsanspruch*).[^18] This happens automatically; you don't have to apply for it.

If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), the *[Agentur für Arbeit](/glossary/Bundesagentur%20f%C3%BCr%20Arbeit)* pays for your health insurance.[^17]

If you don't get unemployment benefits, you must pay around {{GKV_ESTIMATED_MIN_CONTRIBUTION|cur}}€ per month for public health insurance. Your spouse's or your parents' public health insurance can cover you for free (*[[Familienversicherung]]*).

### What happens to your pay and bonuses

Your employer must pay you until the end of your [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist). They must pay your full salary, even if they don't make you work.[^23]

After you stop working, you stop getting paid. You might get unemployment benefits. This gives you financial support while you [find another job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

If you get a yearly performance bonus, your employer must pay that bonus even if you leave the company.[^22] The bonus can be prorated. For example, if you should get a performance bonus every year, but you quit in September, you should get 75% of the promised bonus. If you don't get your bonus, [talk to a lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin).

### What happens to your unused vacation days

You normally use your last vacation days during your notice period.[^14]

Request an *[[Urlaubsbescheinigung]]* from your employer.

The same vacation day rules apply. You can still go on sick leave.
