In this guide, I explain why I work with them, and why I recommend their services.

## What is Feather Insurance?

[Feather](https://allaboutberlin.com/out/popsure) is a German insurance broker in Berlin. They sell different insurance products like health insurance, liability insurance, legal insurance, dental insurance, etc.

Feather is not an insurance company, but an insurance broker. A broker sells insurance from different companies, and helps you choose insurance. They do not offer their own insurance.

## Why I recommend Feather

I recommend Feather **because I trust them**. We work together since 2018. I am a Feather customer.

### They helped me save 400€ per month

In 2020, I wanted to switch to private health insurance. I have pre-existing health problems, so it was not easy. Normally, every private health insurer would refuse to cover me. Rob from Feather spent *months* negotiating with them, and in March 2021, I was finally accepted. Now, I save 400€ per month on health insurance, and I get better coverage than before.

I also found many positive comments about Feather in Facebook communities. Many people used them to [get health insurance for their German residence permit](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-visa-health-insurance).

### They help me with this website

In 2018, I met with Feather's founder to talk about health insurance. I was writing a [health insurance guide](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance), and I had many questions. Rob answered my questions for over an hour, then answered more questions by email. He did not ask for anything in return.

Since then, we wrote many guides together. We talk at least once a month. I ask many hard questions, and he always gives me correct, honest answers. I always verify the information with other sources, and it's always accurate.

### They help my readers

All About Berlin does not sell any services. When my readers have questions I can't answer, I tell them to talk to an expert.

This means I need experts I can trust. They must be honest, know how to work with immigrants, and speak English.

For health insurance, my trusted experts are Feather, B-Protected and Derrick Loehr. I know that their health insurance is [valid for a residence permit application](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-visa-health-insurance). I know that they recommend public health insurance, even when private health insurance makes them more money. I know that they speak fluent English. I know that their founder cares about more than just money. This is why I recommend them.

I also like to work with health insurance brokers because their advice is free. They get paid by health insurance companies when they sign a new customer. This is very good for my readers, because they don't need to pay to get help.

## How I get paid by Feather

The Feather links on this website are affiliate links. When I send Feather a customer, they pay me.

Many other websites work this way. This is why so many blogs recommend Feather, Ottonova, Coya, GetSafe, N26 and other products. They don't use those products, and they rarely understand them. Those are not customer reviews, those are ads.

I don't do this. I recommend Feather and other services because I use them, understand them, and trust them. This is why my [reviews](https://allaboutberlin.com/search?q=review) are often critical. I don't pretend to like a product to make more money. It's my [official policy](https://allaboutberlin.com/impressum#content-policy).

## Conclusion

I recommend Feather, because I know you can trust them. I used their services, I know their founder personally, and I work with them since 2018. If you need help with health insurance, they're the right people to contact. You have my word.

## Other insurance brokers I recommend

I work with many different insurance brokers, because I check information with multiple sources. I also recommend Daniel from [B-Protected](https://b-protected.de/). I also work with Daniel since a long time, and he helped hundreds of my readers, even when there was no benefit to him. Like Feather, they help me write guides on this website. I could not write about health insurance without them.
