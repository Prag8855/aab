## How the driving exams work

You take the theoretical exam on a computer. The exam is available in 13 different languages: Arabic, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Croatian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Turkish.[^0]

You take the practical exam in a car. You must drive around the city, and prove that you can park correctly.

The German driving exam is not easy. People often have to take the exam multiple times.

## Trade your foreign driving licence

Your foreign driving licence [might be valid in Germany](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence#can-you-already-drive-in-germany). You can sometimes convert it to a German driving licence. You might not need driving lessons.

## List of English-speaking driving schools

A few driving schools offer driving lessons in English.

You don't need English theory, because most schools let you practice with an app, and the app is available in English. However, you *must* have an English-speaking instructor if you want to prepare for your practical exam.

Many schools say they offer driving lessons in English, but only offer the online material in English. Always ask if the instructors really speak English.

If a driving school is missing from this list, [let me know](/suggest-business).
