**It depends on how the website makes money**, but it's usually a *[[Gewerbe]]*.

## Commercial websites

### Websites that are part of your business

If you are a *[[Freiberufler]]*, and your website is part of your business, it's not a *[[Gewerbe]]*. You don't need to register your website as a separate business. For example, a freelance writer can use their website to promote their services.

### Websites that are a standalone business

If your website is a stand-alone business, and you make money by selling ads, referrals or products, it's a *Gewerbe*.[^0] You must [get a trade licence](/guides/gewerbeschein) (*[[Gewerbeschein]]*) and [register your business with the *Finanzamt*](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung).

For example, if you make money by placing ads on your blog, you need to register it as a *Gewerbe*. An online store is also a *Gewerbe*.

## Non-commercial websites

If your website is not used for any commercial activity, then you don't need to declare it as a business. For example, you don't need to register your personal blog or hobby project as a business if you don't make money with it.
