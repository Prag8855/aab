Title: My review of Kontist (it's bad)
Short_title: Review of Kontist
Description: I use Kontist as my business bank since January 2022. All of my business transactions go through it. This is my honest review of their service.

[Kontist](/out/kontist) is a bank in Germany. They offer business bank accounts ([*Geschäftskonto*](/glossary/Gesch%C3%A4ftskonto)) for freelancers.

I have a Duo account since January 2022. All my business transactions go through my Kontist account.

This is my review of Kontist, feature by feature.

## Fees

You get 10 free transactions per month (incoming and outgoing), then you pay 0.15€ per transaction. This new fee came without warning in September 2022.

I already pay 13€ per month for a Duo account. Now I also pay around 5€ per month in transaction fees. If you have a lot of small transactions, it gets very expensive.

There is also a 1.7% fee for payments in foreign currencies (incoming and outgoing), and a 2€ ATM withdrawal fee.

## Automatic tax deductions

If you are self-employed, you must put money aside for [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) and VAT payments. It's hard to know how much money you really have.

Kontist fixes this. It automatically puts money aside for income tax and VAT. In the mobile app, you can see your total balance, and how much you can keep.

This feature only works in the mobile app. The web app only shows you your total balance.

I like this feature. It's why I opened a Kontist account. [Holvi](/out/holvi) has this feature too. [N26 Business](/out/n26-business) lets you put money aside in "spaces".

### Automatic VAT

For each transaction, you decide how much [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) to set aside. You set the VAT manually for each transaction (0%, 7% or 19%).

Kontist uses AI to automate bookkeeping, but it's often wrong. Instead of leaving transactions uncategorised, it puts them in the wrong category, with the wrong VAT.

For example, I send money to my [N26](/out/n26) account every month, and Kontist still marks it as an expense with 19% VAT. One client pays me every month, and Kontist sets the wrong VAT every time.

There is no way to turn the AI off.

If you use Kontist with [LexOffice](/out/lexoffice), it's better. You categorise transactions in LexOffice, and they are categorised in Kontist too.

[![](https://localhost/images/_contentFullwidth2x/kontist-sort-transactions.png)](https://localhost/images/kontist-sort-transactions.png "You must set the VAT on each transaction. The AI does it automatically, but it's often wrong")

[![](https://localhost/images/_contentFullwidth2x/kontist-vat-value.png)](https://localhost/images/kontist-vat-value.png "I can see how much VAT and income tax I owe on each transaction.")

### Automatic income tax

Kontist sets some of your income aside for [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).

It does not calculate your income tax rate; it just sets a fixed percentage of your income aside. You must [calculate your income tax rate](https://localhost/tools/tax-calculator) yourself. This is reasonable, because Kontist does not have enough information to calculate your income tax.

Kontist does not support the [trade tax](/glossary/Gewerbesteuer), which many freelancers pay. There is no way to label a transaction as a trade tax payment.

## Invoicing and bookkeeping

Kontist lets you create invoices, but it does not let you send them. You must download the invoices and send them yourself. Otherwise, it works fine.

Kontist matches transactions to invoices, and automatically marks the invoices as paid.

You can attach receipts to transactions. If you do it in LexOffice, the receipts also appear in Kontist. You can't download all the receipts; you must contact customer service.

### No monthly reports

Kontist doesn't tell you how much you earned in a month. If you run a business, this information is important.

The [Kontist Duo plan](/out/kontist-plans) comes with [Lexoffice](/out/lexoffice). Lexoffice is a great accounting tool with much better reports. [Holvi](/out/holvi)'s dashboard also shows this information.

### Limited export options

Kontist integrations are limited: it only connects to [Lexoffice](/out/lexoffice) and [FastBill](https://www.fastbill.com/)  
 (with a Premium or Duo account).

You can export your transactions to CSV or MT940 and use it in other programs, even with the free account.

You can only export transactions in the mobile app. You can't open the CSV or MT940 files on your phone; you must send them to your computer first.

There is no way to export all transactions *and* attached invoices, but you can contact their support to export all your data.

### No access for tax advisors

You can book a tax advisor in the Kontist app. If you already have a tax advisor, you can't give them access to your Kontist account. You have to manually export your data and send it to them every month.

[Qonto](/out/penta) and [Holvi](/out/holvi) have tax advisor access.

## Integration with other tools

### LexOffice

LexOffice is a bookkeeping and invoicing tool.

Kontist works well with [LexOffice](/out/lexoffice).

LexOffice gets transactions from Kontist (and other banks). You can attach receipts to transactions, set the VAT, etc. The same information will appear in Kontist.

Since a few months, I do all my bookkeeping and invoicing in LexOffice, and I just use Kontist as a regular bank account.

### Other accounting tools

Kontist also integrates with FastBill. It does not integrate with any English-speaking tax software.

## Web app and mobile app

### Missing features

Some features are only in the mobile app. Some are only in the web app. It makes no sense.

- You can only create invoices in the web app.
- You can only export your transactions in the mobile app. The file you get can only be opened on a computer.
- You can only change your tax information in the mobile app.
- You can only manage your credit cards in the mobile app.
- The web app only shows your total balance, not the amount you can keep after taxes.

Some features are completely missing:

- You can't change your address and other personal information. You must contact customer service.

### Too many ads

Kontist tries *really* hard to sell you more services. Every part of the app invites you to upgrade your account or refer a friend. There is no way to turn this off.

I already pay 13€ per month for a Duo account. I don't want to see ads.

![Kontist mobile app upsells](https://localhost/images/kontist-mobile-app-upsells.png "Half of the buttons are ads, even with the most expensive account")

### SMS confirmation codes

Kontist uses the mobile app for two-factor authentication. If you log in on the web app, you must confirm it in the mobile app.

Kontist uses [insecure](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/12/why-using-sms-authentication-for-2fa-is-not-secure/) SMS confirmation codes for bank transfers and PIN changes. It's hard to receive codes by SMS when you travel[^0].

## Tax advisor service

Kontist has a tax advisor service. A tax advisor can verify your transactions, and declare your taxes for you. Starting at 79€ per month, it's a good deal. Hiring a tax advisor would be more expensive, and they're really hard to find[^1].

I already have a tax advisor, so I did not test this feature.

## English support

With Kontist, you can do everything in English. The website, the app and the customer support are in English. You don't need to speak German.

[N26 Business](/out/n26-business), [Holvi](/out/holvi), [Qonto](/out/penta) and [Revolut](/out/revolut-business) also speak English.

## Opening an account

It was *very* easy to open my account. It took 5 minutes to create the account, and 5 more minutes to verify my identity. I did not need a registered address (*[[Anmeldung]]*). I only needed my phone, and an ID document. I could open my account in English or German, but the terms and conditions are only in German.

Kontist uses IDNow to verify your ID[^2]. Some passports are not supported by IDNow. Other online banks also have this problem.

### Good customer service

Kontist has phone, email and chat support. Some banks only have email or chat support.

They usually answer in 1 business day. They give complete and useful answers. They speak English.

### Free account

Kontist offers a free business bank account. It has automatic bookkeeping.

The free account is very limited:

- You can only have 300€ per month in transactions.
- You only get 10 free transactions per month, then you pay 15 cents per transaction.
- It only comes with a virtual credit card, no physical card.
- No invoicing, no data exports, no integration with bookkeeping tools.

## Other notes

### Kontist is not a bank

Kontist is not a bank. It's a financial services provider. Your money is kept by [Solarisbank](https://www.solarisbank.com/en/). [Qonto](/out/penta) and [Finom](/out/finom) also use Solarisbank[^3]. This makes no difference to you. You just need to use "Solarisbank" on your invoices.

Solarisbank has its own fees. You must agree to their terms and conditions when you open a Kontist account.

### You can't deposit cash

There is no way to deposit cash in your Kontist account[^4]. You must [transfer money](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung) from another bank account.

When you open an account, you get your first invoice from Kontist. You must transfer money from another account to pay it.

### No corporations or partnerships

Kontist is for freelancers, small businesses and sole traders. Corporations and partnerships (GmbH, KG, UG, or GbR) are not supported[^5].

## Conclusion

Kontist is *okay*, but it could do better. It costs around 9€ per month plus fees, and it helps you with your accounting.

### The good

- You see how much money is yours, and how much is for taxes.
- Their tax advisor service is cheaper than getting a tax advisor.
- The web app and mobile apps are reliable.
- It works really well with [LexOffice](/out/lexoffice), a pretty good accounting tool. The Kontist Duo plan is a great deal.

### The bad

- 15 cents per transaction after 10 transactions is a slap in the face.
- Auto-categorization does not work. You can't trust the Kontist AI. This is fine if you do your accounting in LexOffice.
- Real-time tax estimation just multiplies the amount by a fixed percentage that you choose. It does not really calculate your income tax.
- The free account is no longer free for most people.
- The invoicing tool is half-finished.

### Konstist alternatives

If you need a business bank account to start a business in Germany, there are many other options.

- [Holvi](/out/holvi) is very similar to Kontist. It seems to have better bookkeeping, better invoicing, and better reports.
- [Finom](/out/finom) is also very similar to Kontist.
- [N26 Business](/out/n26-business) is exactly like N26, but for businesses. I have an N26 account since 2016, and [I like it](https://localhost/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26). If you need a free, English-speaking business bank, it could work for you. You can't have a personal N26 account *and* an N26 Business account.
