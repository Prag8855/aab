## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a Blue Card **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a Blue Card at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you already have a Blue Card from another EU country
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).

Usually, you can't start working before you get your Blue Card.[^35] You might need to wait a few months with no income. It's cheaper and safer to [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).

**If you have a Blue Card from another EU country** since at least 12 months, you can start working before you get your Blue Card.[^33]

**If you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)**, you can work 10 hours per week for your new employer while you wait for your Blue Card.[^11]

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and [look for work](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

* **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you don't need a visa to travel to Germany. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit.[^9]

* **If you already have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**, you can stay in Germany. When you apply for a Blue Card, your current residence permit stays valid until the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* makes a decision. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon) while you wait for your Blue Card, you don't have to leave Germany.

* **If you have a Blue Card from another EU country**, you can come to Germany without a visa.[^38] If you had your Blue Card for at least 12 months, you can already move to Germany and start working.[^33] After you arrive, you must get a German Blue Card at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

* **If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**, you can't apply for a Blue Card. You can't look for work with a tourist visa. Your Blue Card application will be rejected.[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you need a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) to come to Germany. It's easier to [apply for the Blue Card in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).[^19]

### 2. Find a job

You must have a job offer **before you apply for the Blue Card**.[^15] Your job offer must meet the [Blue Card requirements](#blue-card-requirements).

- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents ↓](#required-documents)**

While you wait, you should also...

- [ ] **Register your address** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)

You also get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). You might need it to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), get a SIM card, and use government services. - [How to register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)
