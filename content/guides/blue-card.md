{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## What is a Blue Card?

The EU [[Blue Card]] (*Blaue Karte*) is a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) for skilled workers with a university degree.

With a Blue Card, you can...

- Live and work in Germany
- Visit countries in the [Schengen area](https://www.axa-schengen.com/en/countries-schengen-area)[^13]
- Bring your family to Germany with the [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa)[^14]
- Become a German [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 33 months (21 months if you speak B1 German)[^10]

## Who needs a Blue Card?

If you are not a citizen of the [[European Union]], the [[EEA]] or Switzerland, you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live in Germany. The Blue Card is a type of residence permit.

**[Who needs a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit)**

## Blue Card requirements

To get a Blue Card, you need...[^18]

- [ ] **A job offer in Germany**  
    You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply for the Blue Card.[^15] You must also have...
    - [ ] **A high income**  
        Your salary must be over {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year (before taxes, without bonuses).[^3] [If there is a shortage of skilled workers in your field](#shortage-occupations), you salary must be over {{BLUE_CARD_SHORTAGE_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year.
    - [ ] **Job experience**  
        You have the skills and experience to do this job. For example, you can't get a Blue Card for a programming job if you have no programming education or experience.
    - [ ] **Permission to do this job**  
        You must have all the qualifications and permits to do this job in Germany.[^12] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need specific qualifications. Use the [recognition finder](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession) to know if your profession requires specific qualifications.
- [ ] **A university degree**  
    Your university degree must be recognised in Germany. Use [Anabin](https://hallogermany.com/blog/anabin-guide-academic-degrees) to see if your school and degree are recognised. - [How to use Anabin](https://hallogermany.com/blog/anabin-guide-academic-degrees)

**You do not need to speak German** to get a Blue Card.

### Requirements for shortage occupations

There is a shortage of these skilled workers in Germany:

- Programmers and IT workers
- Engineers
- Architects
- Doctors (but not dentists)
- Graphic designers and multimedia designers
- Mathematicians
- Natural scientists
- Urban planners

If you work in one of those occupations, **you can get a Blue Card with a lower salary**. The minimum salary is {{BLUE_CARD_SHORTAGE_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per year instead of {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€.[^21]

If your salary is under {{BLUE_CARD_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€, your Blue Card application take a bit longer, because the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* must get the [[ZAV]]'s approval.

## Blue Card alternatives

If you can't get a Blue Card, there are other ways to work in Germany:

- **[Work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)**  
    For skilled workers with professional training. No minimum salary. No university degree requirement. You must have vocational training in your field. - [How to apply](/guides/german-work-visa)
- **[[Working Holiday Visa]]** and **[[Youth Mobility Visa]]**  
    Lets you work in Germany for 1 year. No minimum salary. No education requirement. Only for young people from certain countries.
- **[[Internship visa]]**  
    For university students who have an internship in Germany. It's valid for up to 6 months.
- **[[Au pair visa]]**  
    Work as an [au pair](/glossary/Au%20pair). No income requirement. No education requirement.
- **[[Family reunion visa]]**  
    For spouses of German residents. No income requirement. No education requirement. You can do any kind of work.[^16]

**[Types of residence permits ➞](/guides/residence-permit#types-of-residence-permits)**

## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a Blue Card **after you move to Germany**: first you come to Germany, then you apply for a Blue Card at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German residence permit, and you want to renew or change it
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).

You must wait for your Blue Card to start working. You might need to wait a few months with no income. If you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa), you can work 10 hours per week for your new employer while you wait for your Blue Card.[^11]

If you don't have a lot of savings, it's cheaper and safer to [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).

**The instructions below are only for Berlin**. The process is different in other German cities.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and [look for work](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

* **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you don't need a visa to travel to Germany. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit.[^9]

* **If you are a citizen of any other country**, you need a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) to come to Germany. It's cheaper and easier to [apply for the Blue Card in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).[^19]

* **If you already have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**, you can stay in Germany. When you apply for a Blue Card, your current residence permit stays valid until the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* makes a decision. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon) while you wait for your Blue Card, you don't have to leave Germany.

* **If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**, you can't apply for a Blue Card. You can't look for work with a tourist visa. Your Blue Card application will be rejected.

### 2. Find a job

You must have a job offer **before you apply** for the Blue Card. The job must meet the [Blue Card requirements](#blue-card-requirements).

**[How to find a job in Berlin ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

It's better if you [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you come to Germany. When you arrive, you can focus on other problems like [finding an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), [opening a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany) and [getting health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance).

### 3. Prepare your Blue Card application

Before your Blue Card appointment at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, you must...

- [ ] **Find a place to live**  
    To get a Blue Card, you must prove that you have a place to live. It's really hard to find an apartment. You need a place that lets you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). If you can't register your address, you might not get a Blue Card.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Open a bank account**  
    You need a bank account to pay your rent, pay your Blue Card application fees, and get paid by your employer. You can use a bank from any EU country. - [How to choose a bank](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)
- [ ] **Get health insurance**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung) to get a Blue Card. The best way to choose health insurance is to [talk to an insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). - [How to choose health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents ↓](#required-documents)**

While you wait, you can also...

- [ ] **Register your address** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    This is how you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer). Your employer needs your tax ID when you start working. You also get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). You might need it to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), get a SIM card, and use government services. - [How to register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)

### 4. Apply for the Blue Card online

You must apply for the Blue Card online.[^4] You do not need an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment.

**[Apply for the Blue Card](https://liste-antraege-bc01.bda.service.berlin.de/intelliform/forms/default/bda/LEA/BlaueKarte/index)** - berlin.de

The application fee is {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€. It's cheaper for Turkish citizens. You can pay with Visa, MasterCard, PayPal or [[Girocard]], but not with cash.[^8]

After you pay and send your application, you will get a PDF by email. This is the proof of your application. You must save it for later.

### 5. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* must process your application. This takes around 6 weeks, but it can take much longer.

Your current residence permit stays valid until the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* makes a decision. If you don't get a decision after 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-you-dont-get-an-answer).[^20]

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon)**

In a few weeks, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will send you an appointment invitation by email.

### 6. Go to your residence permit appointment

During this appointment, they take your fingerprints for your Blue Card.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**  
    If you can't prove that you have an appointment, you can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde*.
- [ ] **Proof of your online application**  
    You get this document by email after your online application.
- [ ] **1 biometric photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)

**[What happens at the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

### 7. Get your Blue Card

In a few weeks, you will receive two letters:

- **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives before your new Blue Card. You can use it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your Blue Card.
- **Your new Blue Card**  
    You either get your Blue Card by post, or you get an invitation to collect your Blue Card at the *Ausländerbehörde*.

Your Blue Card is a plastic card. It's usually **valid for 4 years**.[^17] It can be valid for a shorter time if you have a limited work contract. For example, if you have a 2 year work contract, your Blue Card will be valid for 2 years + 3 months.[^3]

Verify the information on your new Blue Card. *Ausländerbehörde* employees sometimes make mistakes.

### 8. Start working in Germany

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working)**

## How to apply in your home country

You can apply for a Blue Card **before you move to Germany**. You must apply at the German embassy or consulate. You will get a [temporary visa](/glossary/National%20Visa) for up to 1 year. When you get your temporary visa, you can move to Germany and [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working). After you arrive, you must convert your temporary visa to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).

This is **cheaper and safer**, because you can start working as soon as you arrive.

The Blue Card application process is a little different at each embassy and consulate.

### 1. Get an appointment at the German embassy or consulate

Get an appointment at your local German embassy or consulate. It can be really hard to find an appointment. You might only get an appointment a few months later. Start looking as soon as you can.
