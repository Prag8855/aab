## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a Blue Card **after you move to Germany**. While you wait for your Blue Card, you can't work. You must buy food and pay rent with no income. It's cheaper and safer to [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

You can apply for a Blue Card after you move to Germany if...

- You are a citizen of of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}
- **or** you already have a German residence permit, and you want to renew or change it
- **or** you travel to Germany with a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).

**These instructions are for Berlin only**. The process can be different in other German cities.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and [look for work](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

**If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you don't need a visa to travel to Germany. You can stay in Germany for 90 days before you need a residence permit.

**If you are a citizen of any other country**, you need a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) to come to Germany.

**If you already have a residence permit**, you can stay in Germany. When you apply for a Blue Card, your current residence permit stays valid until you get the Blue Card.

**If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**, you can't apply for a Blue Card. You can't look for work with a tourist visa. Your Blue Card application will be rejected.

If you can, [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) before you come to Germany. It's really hard to find an apartment in some cities. It's easier to find an apartment if you already have a job offer. You can also stay in a temporary place: a friend's house, a hotel or a furnished apartment. Make sure that you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) at this place.

### 2. Find a job

You must have a job offer before you apply for the Blue Card. The job must meet the [Blue Card requirements](#blue-card-requirements).

- [ ] **Get health insurance**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung) to get a Blue Card. The best way to choose health insurance is to [talk to an insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). - [How to choose health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)
