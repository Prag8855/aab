## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a Blue Card **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a Blue Card at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. You must apply at the *Ausländerbehörde* where you live. You can't apply in another city.

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you already have a Blue Card from another EU country
- **or** you have an [EU Permanent Residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence) in another country
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) or an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]] that you must [convert to a Blue Card](/guides/residence-permit#convert-your-national-visa).

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

Usually, you can't work before you get your Blue Card.[^35] It can take [a long time](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). You might wait a few months with no income. It's cheaper and safer if you [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country), then come to Germany when you have permission to work.

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^42] Your employer might pay for it, or hire someone to help you.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and [look for a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for a job, and apply for the Blue Card in Germany.[^9] You can't work before you get your Blue Card.
- **If you have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    Your current residence permit stays valid until you get your Blue Card. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon) after you sent your Blue Card application, you don't need to leave Germany.
- **If you have a Blue Card from another EU country**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa.[^38] If you have your Blue Card since at least 12 months, you can already start working in Germany.[^33] When you arrive in Germany, you have 1 month to convert your Blue Card to a German one at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.[^41]
- **If you have an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)**  
    You can come to Germany and look for a job. You can work 20 hours per week. To work full time, you must switch to a Blue Card or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa).
- **If you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)**  
    You can come to Germany and look for a job. To start working, you must get a Blue Card or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa).[^11]
- **If you have a [[Schengen visa]]**  
    You can't apply for a Blue Card with a Schengen visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you must [apply for the Blue Card in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^19]

### 2. Find a job

You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply for the Blue Card.[^15] Your job offer must meet the [Blue Card requirements](#blue-card-requirements).

**[How to find a job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

### 3. Prepare your Blue Card application

Before you apply for the Blue Card, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be big enough. You need 9 m^2^ per adult, and 6 m^2^ per child.[^49]
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your total cost of living must be less than your income.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a Blue Card.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-work-visa-or-blue-card)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance.
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents ➞](#required-documents)**

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. You must prepare their documents too.

While you wait for your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for your registration certificate.[^46] - [Why the *Anmeldung* is important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address)
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#open-a-bank-account)**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your Blue Card application fee, and get paid by your employer. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

### 4. Apply for the Blue Card online

You must apply for the Blue Card online.[^4] You do not need an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment. It takes 15 minutes.

**[Apply for the Blue Card](/out/auslanderbehorde-blue-card)**

It costs {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€. It's cheaper for Turkish citizens. You can pay with Visa, Mastercard or PayPal. You can't pay with cash or [[Girocard]].[^8] The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

After you pay and send your application, you can download a PDF. This is your proof of application. Save it for later.

### 5. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application, then invite you for an appointment. This can take [a few weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). While you wait, your current [[National Visa]] or residence permit stays valid, even if it should expire.

**[What happens while you wait ➞](/guides/residence-permit#wait)**

### 6. Go to your Blue Card appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment. Follow the instructions in the email. They might ask you to bring more documents.

**[How to prepare for your appointment ➞](/guides/residence-permit#go-to-your-appointment)**

### 7. Get your Blue Card

Go to your second *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment and pick up your Blue Card. Your new Blue Card is valid for up to 3 years.[^17] If you have a limited work contract, your Blue Card is valid for a shorter time. For example, if you have a 2 year work contract, your Blue Card is valid for 2 years + 3 months.[^3]

**[How to pick up your Blue Card ➞](/guides/residence-permit#pick-up-your-residence-card)**

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/blueCard.html" %}

### 8. Start working in Germany

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working)**

**[Your first month in Germany ➞](/guides/moving-to-berlin#your-first-month-in-berlin)**

## How to apply in your country

You can also apply for a Blue Card in your country, then move to Germany. This is **cheaper and safer**, because when you arrive in Germany, you can already start working. You don't need to wait in Germany without an income.

You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply.[^15] Your job offer must meet the [Blue Card requirements](#blue-card-requirements).

**[How to apply in your country ➞](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-apply-in-your-country)**

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**.[^2] If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, embassy or consulate where you apply. - [Find your embassy or consulate](/out/consulate-finder)

- [ ] **Passport**  
    When you apply online, include a colour scan of your passport. When you go to your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, bring your original passport. You get it back during the appointment; they do not keep it.
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Job contract** or **job offer**  
    Bring the original, not a copy.
- [ ] **[Job description form](/documents/erklaerung-zum-beschaeftigungsverhaeltnis-2024.pdf)** (*Erklärung zum Beschäftigungsverhältnis*)  
    Your employer should fill this form and sign it. Download the form [here](/documents/erklaerung-zum-beschaeftigungsverhaeltnis-2024.pdf) or [on Berlin.de](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/_assets/stellenbeschreibung.pdf).
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Travel insurance is not accepted. [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose health insurance.
    - [ ] **Health insurance card**
    - [ ] or **proof of public health insurance**  
        Get a *[Mitgliedsbescheinigung nach 175 SGB V](/images/krankenkasse-mitgliedsbescheinigung-nach-175-sgb-v.png)* from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.
    - [ ] or **proof of private health insurance**  
        Bring your insurance contract, a *Mitgliedsbescheinigung*, and bank statements that show health insurance payments. Get these documents from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.[^6]
- [ ] **Proof of housing**  
    You need a [place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung).  If you apply in Berlin, your home address must be in Berlin.
    - [ ] **Lease**  
        It must show the size of your apartment. Your apartment must be big enough (9 m^2^ per adult, 6 m^2^ per child).[^49] You must make enough money to pay your rent.[^47] It can be a temporary lease, a [[WG]] or a sublet.
    - [ ] and **tenancy confirmation** (*[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*)  
        Some temporary apartments and sublets don't give you this document. You might not get a Blue Card without it.[^1]
    - [ ] and **registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)  
        You must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) to get this document. If you don't have it, your lease and [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) are sometimes enough. At least bring proof that you have a [*Bürgeramt* appointment](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#get-a-burgeramt-appointment).[^5]
- [ ] **University degree**  
    If you are an IT specialist with at least 3 years of experience, you don't need a degree.[^31]
- [ ] **Statement of comparability** (*Zeugnisbewertung*)  
    If your university degree is not recognised in Germany, you must get a statement of comparability (*Zeugnisbewertung*) from the ZAB. If you are an IT specialist with at least 3 years of experience, you don't need this. - [More information](https://www.kmk.org/zab/statement-of-comparability.html)
- [ ] **Occupation practice permit** (*Berufsausübungserlaubnis*)  
    If you need specific qualifications to do your job, bring all the required diplomas and permits. For example, doctors, engineers and tax advisors need specific qualifications. Use the [recognition finder](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession) to know if you need specific qualifications.
- [ ] **Translations**  
    If your documents are not in German, bring translations. For certificates and official documents, bring [certified translations](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung). They *sometimes* accept untranslated documents, but don't take the risk. Get translations from [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [Lingoking](/out/lingoking).

**Use PDF files or photos.** Don't use word documents or other file formats.[^37]

## After you get your Blue Card

**[What to do after you get your residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit#after-you-get-your-residence-permit)**

### Give feedback

Tell me how long it took to get your Blue Card. Your feedback helps thousands of people plan their application.

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/blueCard.html" %}

**[See other people's feedback ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

### Renew your Blue Card

Your Blue Card is valid for up to 4 years. In Berlin, you must renew it around 8 weeks before it expires, not sooner.[^16] To renew your Blue Card, you must use [the same form](/out/auslanderbehorde-blue-card) you used to apply for your Blue Card, or [use the contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait).

You can also apply for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 27 months. If you speak B1 German, you can get it after 21 months.[^10]

### If you change jobs

When you change jobs, [tell the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/losing-your-job#tell-the-auslanderbehorde). You might need their permission to work for a different employer.

**[What happens to your Blue Card ➞](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-residence-permit)**

### If you lose your job

If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), your Blue Card stays valid. [Tell the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/losing-your-job#tell-the-auslanderbehorde) as soon as you can. In Berlin, they give you 6 months to find another job. In other cities, they give you at least 3 months.

While you are unemployed, you can get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).

**[What happens to your Blue Card ➞](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-residence-permit)**

**[How to get unemployment benefits ➞](/guides/unemployment-benefits)**

### Travel with a Blue Card

Your Blue Card lets you visit other [[Schengen area]] countries without a visa. You can travel outside of Germany for up to 12 months.[^23] If you travel longer, your Blue Card expires.

**[Travel with a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit#travel-with-a-residence-permit)**

### Self-employment with a Blue Card

Your Blue Card might allow part-time self-employment. [Check your *Zusatzblatt*](/guides/zusatzblatt) to see if it's allowed.

Check your work contract too. You might need to tell your employer about your self-employment. Your employer might forbid self-employment if it competes with their business. For example, don't start a marketing agency while you work for another marketing agency. They can't forbid all self-employment without a reason.[^22]

To become self-employed full-time, you must [apply for a freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa#who-needs-a-freelance-visa), [permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence) or citizenship.

### Apply for permanent residence

If you have a Blue Card, you qualify for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 27 months. If you speak B1 German, you qualify after 21 months.[^48] Permanent residence is better than a Blue Card, because it's not tied to your job.

**[How to apply for permanent residence ➞](/guides/permanent-residence)**
