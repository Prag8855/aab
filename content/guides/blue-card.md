## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a Blue Card **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a Blue Card at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. You must apply at the *Ausländerbehörde* where you live. You can't apply in another city.

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you already have a Blue Card from another EU country
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]]. You just need to [convert it to a Blue Card](#convert-your-national-visa-into-a-blue-card).

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

Usually, you can't work before you get your Blue Card.[^35] It can take time. You might wait a few months with no income. It's cheaper and safer if you [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country), then come to Germany when you are allowed to work.

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500 to 2,000€.[^42] Your employer might pay for it, or hire someone to help you.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and [look for a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for a job, and apply for the Blue Card in Germany.[^9] You can't work before you get your Blue Card.
- **If you have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    Your current residence permit stays valid until you get your Blue Card. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon) after you sent your Blue Card application, you don't need to leave Germany.
- **If you have a Blue Card from another EU country**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa.[^38] If you have your Blue Card since at least 12 months, you can already start working in Germany.[^33] When you arrive in Germany, you have 1 month to convert your Blue Card to a German one at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.[^41]
- **If you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)**  
    You can come to Germany and look for a job. When you find a job, you can apply for the Blue Card. While you wait for your Blue Card, you can work 10 hours per week for your new employer.[^11]
- **If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**  
    You can't apply for a Blue Card with a tourist visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you must [apply for the Blue Card in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^19]

### 2. Find a job

You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply for the Blue Card.[^15] Your job offer must meet the [Blue Card requirements](#blue-card-requirements).

**[How to find a job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

### 3. Prepare your Blue Card application

Before you apply for the Blue Card, you must...

- [ ] **Find a place to live**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-one-address).
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your rent can't be higher than your income.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a Blue Card.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Get health insurance**  
    You need [valid health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-work-visa-or-blue-card). Travel insurance is not accepted. [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance. Their help is free. - [How to choose health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance)
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. You must prepare these documents too.

While you wait for your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **Register your address** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). Your employer needs your tax ID when you start working. You might need a registration certificate to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), get a SIM card, find a [[Kita]] for your children, and use government services. - [How to register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)
- [ ] **Open a bank account**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your Blue Card application fee, and get paid by your employer. You can choose a bank from any EU country. - [How to choose a bank](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)

### 4. Apply for the Blue Card online

You must apply for the Blue Card online.[^4] You do not need an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment. It takes 15 minutes.

**[Apply for the Blue Card](https://liste-antraege-bc01.bda.service.berlin.de/intelliform/forms/default/bda/LEA/BlaueKarte/index)** - berlin.de

It costs {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€. You can pay with Visa, MasterCard, PayPal or [[Girocard]], but not with cash.[^8] It's cheaper for Turkish citizens. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20Absetzbar).

After you pay and send your application, you can download a PDF. This is a proof of application. Save it for later.

### 5. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. It takes a few weeks to get invited for an appointment. After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your Blue Card. If you wait more than 3 months after you apply, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde).[^20]

If you already have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), it stays valid while you wait. You can keep your old job. You don't have to leave Germany. You must wait for your work visa to start working at your new job.

**[If your visa or residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 6. Go to your Blue Card appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door.
- [ ] **Proof of your online application**  
    You get this document by email after you apply online.
- [ ] **1 biometric photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend. It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

The appointment takes around 15 minutes. During the appointment, they take your fingerprints for your Blue Card.

**[Going to the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

### 7. Get your Blue Card

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment,[^22] you get 2 letters:

1. **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your Blue Card.
2. **Your Blue Card**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your Blue Card, or an invitation to collect it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^28]

Your Blue Card is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on it. It's usually **valid for 4 years**.[^17] If you have a limited work contract, your Blue Card is valid for a shorter time. For example, if you have a 2 year work contract, your Blue Card is valid for 2 years + 3 months.[^3]

You also get a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)* that describes the conditions of your work visa. For example, it can say that you can freelance, or that you can only work for your current employer.

Check if the information on your Blue Card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

### 8. Start working in Germany
