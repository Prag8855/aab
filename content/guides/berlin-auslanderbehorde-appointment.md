Description: How to find a appointment for a residence permit at the immigration office (Landesamt für Einwanderung), and what to do if there are no appointments.
Date_created: 2017-09-22

This guide explains how to get an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, and what to do if you can't find one.

You need an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment to...[^3]

- Apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)
- Renew or change your current residence permit
- Convert your [[National Visa]] into a residence permit

If you go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment, they will not help you.

## How to get an appointment

There are 3 ways to get an appointment:[^2]

- **Send your documents and wait** ⭐️  
    Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact) to send your residence permit application, and wait for a response. This is usually the fastest option.
- or **book an appointment online**  
    It's really hard to find an appointment. You must refresh the [appointment booking page](/out/auslanderbehorde-appointment) hundreds of times. Your appointment might be in a few months.

**[Other solutions ↓](#other-solutions)**

### Send your documents and wait

Don't get an appointment. Instead, use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact), send your full [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application, and wait. **This is usually the fastest option**, but it can take a few months to get a reply.

To send your documents...

1. **Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**  
    Write a message in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to write it. Your message must include...
    - [ ] What you want to do
    - [ ] The expiration date of your visa or residence permit
    - [ ] [If your residence permit expires soon](#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*[^23] - [More information](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)
2. **Attach your application documents**  
    Send all the required documents. Complete applications are processed faster.[^23] You can only upload 5 small documents. If possible, use PDF documents. You can [merge PDF documents](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make PDFs smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html) online.
3. **Send your message**  
    If you get an error (*Anti-Spam-Schutz*), it's because you took too long to send your message. Just send it again. After you send the message, click *Zusammenfassung ausdrucken* to print the confirmation message. This is a proof of your residence permit application.
4. **Wait a few weeks**  
    You must wait weeks or months to get an answer. While you wait, you can usually stay in Germany, even [if your residence permit expires](#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon). If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#how-to-sue-the-auslanderbehorde).
5. **Get an Ausländerbehörde appointment**  
    After they process your application, they will email you. Usually, when they contact you, it means that your residence permit is approved.[^12] They usually give you an appointment to bring missing documents or scan your fingerprints. You should get your residence permit {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after the appointment.

You can send your residence permit application by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief), but it's not better or faster.[^23] Do not send your application by fax or email. Use the contact form.

**If you [apply for a Blue Card](/guides/blue-card)**, don't use the contact form. There is a [different form](/guides/blue-card#apply-for-the-blue-card-online) for the Blue Card.

### Book an appointment online

It's really hard to find an appointment. **Usually, there are no appointments available**. Refresh the page every few minutes until you find one. It can take a few weeks to find an appointment.[^0] Your appointment can be in a few months.

To book an appointment...

1. Open the official [appointment booking page](/out/auslanderbehorde-appointment).
2. Choose your nationality and the type of residence permit. If your type of residence permit is not in the list, you must [use the contact form](#send-your-documents-and-wait).
4. Click *Weiter* to see appointment dates. Usually, there are no appointments. Try again until you find one. New appointments appear at random times, mostly during work hours.
5. If there are free appointments, you can select a date and book the appointment. You will get an appointment confirmation by email.

**If you [apply for a Blue Card](/guides/blue-card)**, you don't need an appointment. [Apply for a Blue Card online](/guides/blue-card#apply-for-the-blue-card-online) instead.

**If your situation is urgent**, [contact the *Ausländerbehörde*](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact). They might give you an earlier appointment. Usually, they don't reply, but you should still try.

**[If your visa or residence permit expires soon ↓](#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### Other solutions

- **Buy an Ausländerbehörde appointment**  
    Some services sell *Ausländerbehörde* appointments for around 50€. They use scripts and bots to book appointments before other people. Some of those services are scams.[^22]
- **Apply in another city**  
    If you are a Berlin resident, you must go to the Berlin Ausländerbehörde. If you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) in another city, you can apply at the Ausländerbehörde there. Immigration offices in small cities are often faster.
- **Hire a lawyer**  
    When you hire an [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin). It can speed things up.

## If your residence permit expires soon

Your visa or residence permit might expire while you wait for the *Ausländerbehörde*. Don't panic! Usually, you can stay in Germany.[^20]

### If you have a residence permit or a National Visa

You can stay in Germany after your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or [[National Visa]] expires if...

- **You sent your application documents**  
    You must submit a full residence permit application before your residence permit or National Visa expires.
- or **you booked an Ausländerbehörde appointment**  
    You must book the appointment before your residence permit or National Visa expires. The appointment date can be after it expires.

While you wait for the *Ausländerbehörde*...

- **Work or study like before**  
    The conditions of your current residence permit or National Visa still apply. Look on your *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)* to know what you are allowed to do.
- **Do not leave Germany**  
    You might be unable to re-enter Germany with an expired residence permit or National Visa. If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you can usually travel in the [[Schengen area]], but this can change at any time. If you must travel outside Germany, [ask for a *Fiktionsbescheinigung*](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung).

### Everyone else

**If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you can stay in Germany for 90 days without a visa.[^15][^20] You can stay longer if...

- You have an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment **and** you booked the appointment in your first 90 days in Germany
- or you sent your application documents in your first 90 days in Germany

You need a residence permit to work, study or freelance. If you don't have one, you must wait.

**If you have a [[Schengen visa]]**, you must leave Germany before it expires. You can rarely extend a Schengen visa. You can rarely convert a Schengen visa to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). You can't get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*.[^27]

## Before your appointment

Read your appointment confirmation and follow the instructions. Usually, you must...

- [ ] **Prepare the required documents**  
    This can take a few weeks. Bring all your documents, even if you're not sure you need them. Print everything. Don't staple the pages together. If you forget a document, you might need to come back in a few weeks. It wastes a lot of time.
- [ ] **Hire a translator** (optional)  
    Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring a translator with you. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). If you hire a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) or an [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin), they can also translate for you.

## During your appointment

### Go to the Ausländerbehörde

Go to the correct *Ausländerbehörde*: [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/12kPWwFvb4F1tAVv9) or [Keplerstraße](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tLAzNTxsVW7eRJqi6). **Arrive early.** You need enough time to find the correct waiting room. If you are late, they might refuse to help you.

Bring your appointment confirmation. You need it to enter the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^3]

Inside the *Ausländerbehörde*, Find the right office, floor and room. This information is on your appointment confirmation.

[![Berlin Ausländerbehörde appointment room](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)

Sit in the correct waiting room. Wait until the television calls your number. Go to the office number (*Platz*) you see on the television.

### Go to your interview

The *Ausländerbehörde* employee will ask for your documents one by one. After a few minutes, they will send you back to the waiting room. 5 to 45 minutes later, you must go back to the same office.

During your appointment, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It's a temporary residence permit. You might need it to travel outside of Germany.[^8]

**[What is a Fiktionsbescheinigung? ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

They might ask you to pay a fee. You must pay it at a payment machine in the same building.

**[How to pay the residence permit fee ↓](#pay-the-fee)**

Your resident permit might be approved now or in a few weeks. Most residence permits are approved in a few weeks.[^7] If it's approved now, you get a paper certificate. In a few weeks, you will get a plastic residence permit by post.

### Pay the fee

When your residence permit is approved, you must pay a fee: {{ NATIONAL_VISA_FEE }}€ for a new residence permit or {{ NATIONAL_VISA_RENEWAL_FEE }}€ for a renewal.

- **If you must pay now**, they will give you a plastic [payment card](/images/auslanderbehoerde-kassenkarte.jpg) (*Kassenkarte*). Bring that card to a [payment machine](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg) (*Kassenautomat*). Follow [the signs](/images/auslanderbehoerde-signs.jpg) to find the payment machines. These machines accept cash, EC cards, Visa and Mastercard.[^10] If your card is not accepted, you can also get cash from [this nearby ATM](https://goo.gl/maps/8cBy48WnTfbya13r6), even at night.

- **If you must pay later**, you will get an invoice by post. You will have 30 days to pay.[^25] They might also ask you to pay during your next *Ausländerbehörde* visit.

After you pay, you can go home. Keep your receipt; residence permit fees are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).

![Ausländerbehörde Kassenautomat](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg)

## After your appointment

### If your application is approved

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you get 2 letters:[^7]

1. **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion) of your residence permit.
2. **Your residence permit**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your residence permit, or an invitation to collect your it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.

If you had a German residence permit for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It lets you do any type of work you want. For example, you can switch jobs, go to university or open a restaurant. You don't need permission from the *Ausländerbehörde* to do different things.

Your residence permit is a plastic card. Your address is written on the card. If you move to another address, they will update your residence permit during the *[[Anmeldung]]*. They put a sticker with your new address on your residence permit.

Your residence permit has a chip in it. You can use it with the [AusweisApp](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/home) to log into online government services. By default this feature is not activated. You must [activate it yourself](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion).

**[How to activate the eID function ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### If your application is rejected

If some documents are missing, they will give you a new appointment in a few days. This gives you time to get the missing documents and apply again.

If your current visa expires soon, you might get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It lets you stay in Germany a bit longer.

If you get a rejection letter, it will ask for more information, or tell you why your application was rejected. You have 1 month to respond or appeal. If this happen, you should [hire an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) to help you.

### If you don't get an answer

After you submit your residence permit application, the *Ausländerbehörde* has 3 months to make a decision. If you don't get an answer, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#how-to-sue-the-auslanderbehorde). It can speed things up.

If the *Ausländerbehörde* can't reach you because you changed your address, they will post the information [here](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/service/oeffentliche-zustellungen/).

## Contact the Ausländerbehörde

The *Ausländerbehörde* is really hard to contact. They removed emails and fax numbers from their website. You must use the **[contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**.[^26]

To contact the *Ausländerbehörde*...

1. **Use the contact form**  
    Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments) to contact your department. Do not email or fax the *Ausländerbehörde*.
3. **Wait a few weeks**  
    It takes a few weeks to get an answer. You might wait for months. You might never get an answer.

### How to sue the Ausländerbehörde

After you submit your residence permit application, the *Ausländerbehörde* has 3 months to make a decision. If you don't get an answer after 3 months, you can sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction.[^9] This is called an *Untätigkeitsklage nach [§ 75 VwGO](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwgo/__75.html)*. Usually, it makes them move faster. 

In most cases, the state pays for your legal expenses. In other cases, it costs around 400€. An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can help you do this.
