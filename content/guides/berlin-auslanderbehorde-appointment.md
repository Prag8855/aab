{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## How to get an appointment

You can't visit the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment.[^3]

There are 3 ways to get an appointment:[^2]

- **[Book an appointment online](#book-an-appointment-online)**  
    [Look for an appointment](/out/auslanderbehorde-appointment). Most of the time, there are no appointments. You must refresh the page hundreds of times before you find an appointment. Your appointment could be in a few months.
- or **[send your documents online](#send-your-documents-online)** (recommended)  
    Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact) to send your residence permit application documents. The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application and email you. This is usually the best option.
- or **[buy an appointment](#buy-an-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**  
    Some businesses sell *Ausländerbehörde* appointments for around 50€.

It can take weeks to find an appointment. The appointments are usually a few months later. You must plan for this. It's usually faster to [send your documents online](#send-your-documents-online).

**If your residence permit expires soon**, [send your documents online](#send-your-documents-online). It allows you to stay in Germany after your residence permit expires. - [More information ↓](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon)

### Book an appointment online

**[Book an appointment online](/out/auslanderbehorde-appointment)** on the *Ausländerbehörde* website.

1. Open the official [appointment booking page](/out/auslanderbehorde-appointment)
2. Choose your nationality and the type of residence permit.
4. Click *Next*. If there are free appointments, you can select a date and book the appointment.

**Usually, there are no appointments**. This is not a bug. It's really hard to find an appointment. Refresh the page every few minutes. You might need to do this hundreds of times. It can take a few weeks.[^0]

New appointments appear at random times. There are more appointments during working hours. Short-term appointments appear on Wednesdays and Fridays.[^1]

![The Berlin Ausländerbehörde appointment website showing no free appointments](/images/berlin-auslanderbehorde-no-appointments.png "No appointments found. This is normal.")

If your residence permit expires soon, [send your documents online](#send-your-documents-online) instead. It's usually faster. - [More information ↓](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon)

### Send your documents online

You can **[use the contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)** to send your residence permit application. The *Ausländerbehörde* will give you an appointment when your residence permit is approved. This is usually the fastest option.

If you send all your documents, it counts as a residence permit application. This allows you to stay in Germany even if your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) expires. - [More information ↓](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon)

To send your residence permit application...

1. **Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**  
    Write a message in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator). In your message, include...
    - [ ] What you need
    - [ ] Your full name
    - [ ] Your date and place of birth
    - [ ] Your nationality
    - [ ] The expiration date of your visa or residence permit
    - [ ] If your residence permit expires soon, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*[^23] - [More information](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)
2. **Attach your application documents**  
    Include all required documents. Complete applications are processed faster.[^23]
2. **Wait**  
    The *Ausländerbehörde* takes a long time to answer. It takes a few days to a few months.
3. **Get an Ausländerbehörde appointment**  
    The *Ausländerbehörde* will email you after they process your application. They give usually you an appointment to bring missing documents and scan your fingerprints. This usually means that your residence permit is approved.[^12] You should get your residence permit in {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }}.

You can send also send your application by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief). It's not better or faster.[^23] Do not send your application by fax or email. This does not work any more. You must use the contact form.

### Buy an Ausländerbehörde appointment

Some services sell *Ausländerbehörde* appointments for around 50€. They use scripts to book appointments before other people. Some of those services work, others just steal your money.[^22]

These services are unethical. I will not share their name.

## If your residence permit expires soon

If your visa or residence expires soon, don't panic. You probably don't need to leave Germany.

### If you have a residence permit or a National Visa

You can stay in Germany until the *Ausländerbehörde* makes a decision if...

- You have an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment **and** you booked your appointment while your residence permit was valid[^21]
- or you [sent your application online](#send-your-documents-online) while your residence permit was valid[^13]
- or the *Ausländerbehörde* gives you a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*

In those cases, you can stay in Germany even if your residence permit expires.[^20] You can continue working, freelancing or studying until your appointment date.[^11] You must book the appointment while your residence permit is valid.

If your residence permit expires soon, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It lets you travel outside of Germany after your residence permit expires.

If your residence permit expires, and you travel outside of Germany without a  *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, they might not let you re-enter Germany.[^14]

**[Information about the Fiktionsbescheinigung ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

### If you don't have a residence permit

**If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**,[^15] you can stay in Germany for 90 days without a visa. If you have an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment or if you applied by email, you can stay in Germany until your appointment.[^20] You can't work, study or freelance while you wait for your residence permit.

**You can rarely convert a [[Schengen visa]] to a residence permit**.[^16] You can't come to Germany on a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa), then apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa), [[Blue Card]] or [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).[^17] If you want a German residence permit, you must apply for it in your home country.

**You can rarely extend a Schengen visa**.[^18] An *Ausländerbehörde* appointment does not extend your Schengen visa.[^19] You must leave Germany before your Schengen visa expires. You won't get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]* if you are on a Schengen visa.

During your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, the interviewer can give you a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. This temporary residence permit lets you stay in Germany while you wait for your new residence permit. If you forgot some documents, the *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]* also gives you time to reapply.

## During your appointment

### Going to your appointment

Bring your appointment confirmation. You must have it to enter the Ausländerbehörde.[^3]

Find the right office, floor and room. This information is in the email you get after you book your appointment.

Sit in the waiting room, and wait until your number is called on the television. When your number is called, go to the office number you see on the television.

[![Berlin Ausländerbehörde appointment room](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)

### The residence permit interview

You will sit in front of an *Ausländerbehörde* employee, and show your documents. They will ask for specific documents one by one.

This appointment takes around 10 minutes.[^6] They will tell you to go in the waiting room again. They will call your number again in 5 to 45 minutes.

Some employees speak English, but many only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring a translator with you. [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation) and [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) can go to the *Ausländerbehörde* with you. You can also [bring an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin).

**If your current residence permit expires soon**, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It lets you stay in Germany for a little longer. Some versions of the *Fiktionsbescheinigung* let you travel outside of Germany.[^8]

**[How the Fiktionsbescheinigung works ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

Some residence permits are approved on the same day, during your interview. You get a paper residence permit, pay the fee (if they ask you), and leave. Around 8 weeks later, you get your plastic residence permit by post.

Most residence permits are approved 1 to 6 months later.[^7]


### How to pay the residence permit fee

When your residence permit is approved, you must pay a fee. Some people have to pay now, and others have to pay later. You only pay the fee if your residence permit is approved. If it's rejected, you pay nothing.

**If you have to pay now**, they will give you a plastic [payment card](/images/auslanderbehoerde-kassenkarte.jpg) (*Kassenkarte*). Bring that card to a [payment machine](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg) (*Kassenautomat*). Follow [the signs](/images/auslanderbehoerde-signs.jpg) to find the payment machines. These machines accept cash, EC cards, Visa and Mastercard.[^10] If your card is not accepted, you can also get cash from [this nearby ATM](https://goo.gl/maps/8cBy48WnTfbya13r6), even at night.

**If you have to pay later**, you will get an invoice by post. You will have 30 days to pay.[^25]

![Ausländerbehörde Kassenautomat](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg)

After you pay, you can go home. Keep your receipt; residence permit fees are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).

## After your appointment

### If your application is approved

1 to 6 months after your application,[^7] you will get a letter with the PIN and PUK for your plastic residence permit (*elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel* or *eAT*). You don't need to do anything yet. A few weeks later, you will get your residence permit by post.

Your residence permit is valid between 6 months and 4 years. It depends on what residence permit you get, and how good your application is. Freelancers can get a shorter freelance visa if their income is low or if their health insurance is not good enough. When your residence permit is about to expire, you can renew it. The process is very similar.

If you had a German residence permit for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It lets you do any type of work you want. For example, you could get a full time job, study or even open a restaurant.

Your residence permit is a plastic card, not a sticker in your passport. Your address is written on the card. If you move to another address, they will update your residence permit during the *[[Anmeldung]]*. They just put a sticker with your new address on your residence permit.

After you receive your plastic residence permit, [activate your eAT](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion).

### If your application is rejected

If some documents are missing, they will give you a new appointment in a few days. This gives you time to get the missing documents and apply again.

If your current visa expires soon, you might get a temporary visa (*[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*). It lets you stay in Germany a little longer. It gives you time to apply again.

If you get a rejection letter later, it will ask for more information, or tell you why your application was rejected. You still have a month to respond or appeal. If this happens, you should probably [hire an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) to help you.

If you don't get a residence permit, you pay nothing.

### If you don't get an answer

If you apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you don't get an answer after 3 months, you can sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction.[^9] This is called an *Untätigkeitsklage nach [§ 75 VwGO](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwgo/__75.html)*. Usually, it makes them move faster. In most cases, the state pays for your legal expenses. In other cases, it costs around 400€. [Immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can help you do this.

If the *Ausländerbehörde* can't reach you, they will post the information [here](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/service/oeffentliche-zustellungen/).

## Questions and answers

### How to contact the Ausländerbehörde

The *Ausländerbehörde* removed emails and fax numbers from their website. You must use the **[contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments)**.[^26]

To contact the *Ausländerbehörde*...

1. **Find your department**  
    Use [this page](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments) to find which department (*Referat*) is responsible for you.
2. **Contact your department**  
    Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments) to contact your department. Do not email or fax the *Ausländerbehörde*. You must use the contact form.
3. **Wait**  
    The *Ausländerbehörde* can take weeks or months to answer.[^4] It depends on how urgent your situation is, and how complete your application is.

If you apply for a residence permit, and you don't get an answer after 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#if-you-dont-get-an-answer).

### Do they speak English at the Ausländerbehörde?

**Sometimes, but not always**. You should bring an interpreter with you. [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter) and [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) can go to the *Ausländerbehörde* with you. You can also [bring an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin).

### Which Ausländerbehörde should I go to?

If you are a Berlin resident, you must go to the Berlin Ausländerbehörde. You can also [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) in Brandenburg, and apply to a Brandenburg Ausländerbehörde. It's sometimes faster.[^5]

Berlin has two *Ausländerbehörden*: [Keplerstraße](https://service.berlin.de/standort/327437/en/) and [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://service.berlin.de/standort/121885/en/). They provide different services, and you must choose the correct one.

## Where to get help

**[Where to ask immigration questions ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#immigration-questions)**

If you need someone to go with you, I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation). Kathleen often helps me with *Ausländerbehörde* questions. They also offer help sessions for visa applications. [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) can also go to the *Ausländerbehörde* with you.
