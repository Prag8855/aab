This guide explains how to get an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, and what to do if you can't find one.

You need an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment to...[^3]

- Apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)
- Renew or change your current residence permit
- Convert your [[National Visa]] into a residence permit

If you go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment, they will not help you.[^8]

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## How to get an appointment

Since August 2024, **there is no appointment booking system**. The only way to get an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment is to use their [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact).[^2]

### Send your documents and wait

Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact), send your complete [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application, and wait.[^6] It takes a few weeks to a few months to get an answer. **This is the only way to get an appointment.**

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

If you have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or a [[National Visa]], send your documents 8 weeks before it expires, not sooner.[^1] You must send your application before your residence permit expires.[^5] [If your visa or residence permit expires soon](#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), sending your documents usually allows you to stay in Germany.

To send your documents...

1. **Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**  
    Write a message in German. If you don't speak German, use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator). Your message must include...
    - [ ] What you want to do
    - [ ] The expiration date of your visa or residence permit
    - [ ] [If your residence permit expires soon](#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*[^23] - [More information](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)
2. **Attach your application documents**  
    Send all the required documents. Complete applications are processed faster.[^23] You can only upload 5 small documents. If possible, use PDF documents. You can [merge PDF documents](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make PDFs smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html) online. If you have too many documents, send them by post.[^29]
3. **Send your message**  
    If you get an error (*Anti-Spam-Schutz*), it's because you took too long to send your message. Just send it again. After you send the message, click *Zusammenfassung ausdrucken* to print the confirmation message. This is a proof of your residence permit application. You might not get a confirmation email.[^14]
4. **Wait**  
    It takes [a few weeks to a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to get an answer. While you wait, you can usually stay in Germany, even [if your residence permit expires](#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon). If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#sue-the-auslanderbehorde).
5. **Get an Ausländerbehörde appointment**  
    After they process your application, they will email you. Usually, when they contact you, it means that your residence permit is approved.[^12] They usually give you an appointment to bring missing documents or scan your fingerprints. You should get your residence permit [around 8 weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) after the appointment.{{ fail_on('2025-01-15') }}

You can send your residence permit application by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief), but it's not better or faster.[^23] Do not fax your application.[^17] Use the contact form.

**If you [apply for a Blue Card](/guides/blue-card)**{{ fail_on('2025-01-01') }}, don't use the contact form. There is a [different form](/guides/blue-card#apply-for-the-blue-card-online) for the Blue Card.

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/allTypesStatic.html" %}

### Book an appointment online

You can't book an appointment online. The *Ausländerbehörde* disabled its appointment system in August 2024. You must use the contact form, send your documents, and wait for a reply. It can take [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times).

### Other solutions

- **Use the Business Immigration Service** (BIS)  
    You can apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]] through BIS. It's usually faster. Your employer or your relocation service must register for this service. It's free. - [More information](https://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/our-services/bis-business-immigration-service)
- **Apply in another city**  
    If you are a Berlin resident, you must go to the Berlin Ausländerbehörde. If you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) in another city, you can apply at the Ausländerbehörde there. Immigration offices in small cities are often faster.[^4]
- **Hire a lawyer**  
    Lawyers can't get an appointment faster, but they can pressure the *Ausländerbehörde* to process a case faster. A lawyer can also [sue the Ausländerbehörde](#sue-the-auslanderbehorde) when they are too slow. - [Find a lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin)

## If your residence permit expires soon

[It takes months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to get a residence permit. Your current visa or residence permit might expire while you wait for the *Ausländerbehörde*. Don't panic! Usually, **you can usually stay in Germany**.[^20]

### If you have a residence permit or a National Visa

You can stay in Germany after your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or [[National Visa]] expires if...

- **You sent your application documents**  
    You must submit a complete residence permit application before your residence permit or National Visa expires.[^5]
- or **you booked an Ausländerbehörde appointment**  
    You must book the appointment before your residence permit or National Visa expires.[^18] The appointment can be after it expires.

While you wait for the *Ausländerbehörde*...

- **Work or study like before**  
    After you send a residence permit application, the conditions of your *current* residence permit or National Visa still apply. You can work or study like before. Look on your *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)* to know what you are allowed to do. Some employers don't know that, and they might think they have to fire you.
- **Do not leave Germany**  
    You might be unable to re-enter Germany with an expired residence permit or National Visa. Citizens of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}} [can usually travel](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-without-a-fiktionsbescheinigung). Others need a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*.

**[Travel with an expired residence permit ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-with-a-fiktionsbescheinigung)**

### Everyone else

**If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you can stay in Germany for 90 days without a visa.[^11] You can stay longer if...

- You have an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment **and** you booked the appointment in your first 90 days in Germany
- or you sent your application documents in your first 90 days in Germany

You need a residence permit to work, study or freelance. If you don't have one, you must wait.

**If you have a [[Schengen visa]]**, you must leave Germany before it expires. You can rarely extend a Schengen visa.[^16] You can rarely convert a Schengen visa to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). You can't get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*.[^27]

## Before your appointment

Read your appointment confirmation and follow the instructions. Usually, you must...

- [ ] **Prepare your documents**  
    When you go to your appointment, bring every document that you have not already sent. Bring everything useful. If you forget a document, it can delay your application by a few weeks. Print your documents on A4 paper. Don't staple the pages together.
- [ ] **Hire a translator** (optional)  
    Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring a translator with you. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). If you hire a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) or an [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin), they can also translate for you.

## During your appointment

### Go to the Ausländerbehörde

Go to the correct *Ausländerbehörde*: [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/12kPWwFvb4F1tAVv9), [Keplerstraße](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tLAzNTxsVW7eRJqi6) or [Fasanenstraße](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SGWoaKtse5phxsQj6). **Arrive early.** You need enough time to find the correct waiting room. If you are late, they might refuse to help you.[^24]

**Print your appointment confirmation** and bring it. You need it to enter the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^3]

Inside the *Ausländerbehörde*, Find the right office, floor and room. This information is on your appointment confirmation. The security staff can also help you.

[![Berlin Ausländerbehörde appointment room](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)

Sit in the correct waiting room. Wait until the television calls your number. Go to the office number (*Platz*) you see on the television.

### Go to your interview

The *Ausländerbehörde* employee will ask for your documents one by one. After a few minutes, they will send you back to the waiting room. A few minutes later, you must go back to the same office.

During your appointment, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It's a temporary residence permit. You might need it to travel outside of Germany.

**[What is a Fiktionsbescheinigung? ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

They might ask you to pay a fee. You must pay it at a payment machine. The machine is somewhere else in the *Ausländerbehörde*.

**[How to pay the residence permit fee ➞](#pay-the-fee)**

If they approve your residence permit, they must print the plastic card. You will get a second appointment to collect your residence permit [in around 8 weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). You might get a [temporary document](/images/temporary-freelance-visa.jpg) that confirms that your residence permit was approved. It allows you to start working, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to leave and re-enter Germany.

### Pay the fee

When your residence permit is approved, you must pay a fee: {{ NATIONAL_VISA_FEE }}€ for a new residence permit, {{ NATIONAL_VISA_RENEWAL_FEE }}€ for a renewal, or {{ MIN_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE }}€ to {{ MAX_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE }}€ for permanent residence.

- **If you must pay now**, they will give you a plastic [payment card](/images/auslanderbehoerde-kassenkarte.jpg) (*Kassenkarte*). Bring that card to a [payment machine](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg) (*Kassenautomat*). Follow [the signs](/images/auslanderbehoerde-signs.jpg) to find the payment machines. These machines accept cash, EC cards, Visa and Mastercard.[^10] If your card is not accepted, you must get cash from an ATM.
- **If you must pay later**, you will get an invoice by post. You will have 30 days to pay.[^25] They might also ask you to pay during your next *Ausländerbehörde* visit.

After you pay, you can go home. Keep your receipt; residence permit fees are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).

## After your appointment

### Give feedback

Tell me how your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment went. Your feedback helps thousands of people plan their residence permit application.

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/allTypesStatic.html" %}

**[See other people's feedback ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

### If your application is approved

Go to your second *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment to pick up your new residence permit. Bring your passport and your old residence permit. If you pick up a residence permit for a child, they don't need to come with you.[^7]

Your residence permit is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on it. Check if the information on your card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

You might also get a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. It describes the conditions of your residence permit. For example, it might say that you can change employers, or that self-employment is allowed.

You will also get a letter with **the activation code for your [[eID]]**. You need it to [activate the eID function](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion) of your residence permit. This lets you use your residence permit to log into online government services.

**[How to activate the eID function ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### If your application is rejected

If some documents are missing, you have 2 options:

- **Send the missing documents by email**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    If you have the missing documents at home, ask if you can email them. You will pay the fee and give your fingerprints, so you don't need another *Ausländerbehörde* visit.[^32]
- or **get another appointment**  
    They will give you another appointment in a few days. It gives you time to prepare the missing documents.

If your current visa or residence permit expires soon, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It lets you stay in Germany a bit longer. If they refuse, you can insist. You have the right to get one.

If you get a rejection letter, it will ask for more information, or tell you why your application was rejected. You have 1 month to respond or appeal. If this happens, [hire an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) to help you.

### If you don't get an answer

After you submit your residence permit application, the *Ausländerbehörde* has 3 months to make a decision.[^28] If you don't get an answer, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#sue-the-auslanderbehorde). It does not always help.

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

If the *Ausländerbehörde* can't reach you because you changed your address, they will post the information [here](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/service/oeffentliche-zustellungen/).

## Contact the Ausländerbehörde

The *Ausländerbehörde* is really hard to contact. They removed emails and fax numbers from their website. You must use the **[contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**.[^26]

To contact the *Ausländerbehörde*...

1. **Use the contact form**  
    Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments) to contact your department. Do not email or fax the *Ausländerbehörde*.
3. **Wait a few weeks**  
    The *Ausländerbehörde* [takes weeks or months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to answer.

### Fax the Ausländerbehörde

**Fax does not work.**[^13] Do not fax the *Ausländerbehörde*. It's not better or faster. Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments).

## Sue the Ausländerbehörde

After you submit your residence permit application, the *Ausländerbehörde* has 3 months to make a decision. If you don't get an answer after 3 months, you can sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction.[^9] This is called an *Untätigkeitsklage nach [§ 75 VwGO](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwgo/__75.html)*. Usually, it makes them move faster.[^21] 

In most cases, the state pays for your legal expenses. In other cases, it costs around 400€, because the *Ausländerbehörde* reacts without going to court. An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can help you do this.
