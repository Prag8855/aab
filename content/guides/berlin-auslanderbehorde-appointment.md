### Send your documents and wait

5. **Get an Ausländerbehörde appointment**  
    After they process your application, they will email you. Usually, when they contact you, it means that your residence permit is approved.[^12] They usually give you an appointment to bring missing documents or scan your fingerprints. You should get your residence permit [around 8 weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) after the appointment.{{ fail_on('2025-01-15') }}

### Book an appointment online

You can't book an appointment online. The *Ausländerbehörde* disabled its appointment system in August 2024. You must use the contact form, send your documents, and wait for a reply. It can take [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times).

## Before your appointment

Read your appointment confirmation and follow the instructions. Usually, you must...

- [ ] **Prepare your documents**  
    When you go to your appointment, bring every document that you have not already sent. Bring everything useful. If you forget a document, it can delay your application by a few weeks. Print your documents on A4 paper. Don't staple the pages together.
- [ ] **Hire a translator** (optional)  
    Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring a translator with you. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). If you hire a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) or an [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin), they can also translate for you.

## During your appointment

### Go to the Ausländerbehörde

Go to the correct *Ausländerbehörde*: [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://maps.app.goo.gl/12kPWwFvb4F1tAVv9), [Keplerstraße](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tLAzNTxsVW7eRJqi6) or [Fasanenstraße](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SGWoaKtse5phxsQj6). **Arrive early.** You need enough time to find the correct waiting room. If you are late, they might refuse to help you.[^24]

**Print your appointment confirmation** and bring it. You need it to enter the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^3]

Inside the *Ausländerbehörde*, Find the right office, floor and room. This information is on your appointment confirmation. The security staff can also help you.

[![Berlin Ausländerbehörde appointment room](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)

Sit in the correct waiting room. Wait until the television calls your number. Go to the office number (*Platz*) you see on the television.

### Go to your interview

The *Ausländerbehörde* employee will ask for your documents one by one. After a few minutes, they will send you back to the waiting room. A few minutes later, you must go back to the same office.

During your appointment, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It's a temporary residence permit. You might need it to travel outside of Germany.

**[What is a Fiktionsbescheinigung? ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

They might ask you to pay a fee. You must pay it at a payment machine. The machine is somewhere else in the *Ausländerbehörde*.

**[How to pay the residence permit fee ➞](#pay-the-fee)**

If they approve your residence permit, they must print the plastic card. You will get a second appointment to collect your residence permit [in around 8 weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). You might get a [temporary document](/images/temporary-freelance-visa.jpg) that confirms that your residence permit was approved. It allows you to start working, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to leave and re-enter Germany.

### Pay the fee

When your residence permit is approved, you must pay a fee: {{ NATIONAL_VISA_FEE }}€ for a new residence permit, {{ NATIONAL_VISA_RENEWAL_FEE }}€ for a renewal, or {{ MIN_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE }}€ to {{ MAX_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE }}€ for permanent residence.

- **If you must pay now**, they will give you a plastic [payment card](/images/auslanderbehoerde-kassenkarte.jpg) (*Kassenkarte*). Bring that card to a [payment machine](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg) (*Kassenautomat*). Follow [the signs](/images/auslanderbehoerde-signs.jpg) to find the payment machines. These machines accept cash, EC cards, Visa and Mastercard.[^10] If your card is not accepted, you must get cash from an ATM.
- **If you must pay later**, you will get an invoice by post. You will have 30 days to pay.[^25] They might also ask you to pay during your next *Ausländerbehörde* visit.

After you pay, you can go home. Keep your receipt; residence permit fees are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).

## After your appointment

### Give feedback

Tell me how your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment went. Your feedback helps thousands of people plan their residence permit application.

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/allTypesStatic.html" %}

**[See other people's feedback ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

### If your application is approved

Go to your second *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment to pick up your new residence permit. Bring your passport and your old residence permit. If you pick up a residence permit for a child, they don't need to come with you.[^7]

Your residence permit is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on it. Check if the information on your card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

You might also get a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. It describes the conditions of your residence permit. For example, it might say that you can change employers, or that self-employment is allowed.

**[How to read your Zusatzblatt ➞](/guides/zusatzblatt)**

You will also get a letter with **the activation code for your [[eID]]**. You need it to [activate the eID function](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion) of your residence permit. This lets you use your residence permit to log into online government services.

**[How to activate the eID function ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### If your application is rejected

If some documents are missing, you have 2 options:

- **Send the missing documents by email**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    If you have the missing documents at home, ask if you can email them. You will pay the fee and give your fingerprints, so you don't need another *Ausländerbehörde* visit.[^32]
- or **get another appointment**  
    They will give you another appointment in a few days. It gives you time to prepare the missing documents.

If your current visa or residence permit expires soon, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It lets you stay in Germany a bit longer. If they refuse, you can insist. You have the right to get one.

If you get a rejection letter, it will ask for more information, or tell you why your application was rejected. You have 1 month to respond or appeal. If this happens, [hire an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) to help you.

### If you don't get an answer

After you submit your residence permit application, the *Ausländerbehörde* has 3 months to make a decision.[^28] If you don't get an answer, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](#sue-the-auslanderbehorde). It does not always help.

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

If the *Ausländerbehörde* can't reach you because you changed your address, they will post the information [here](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/service/oeffentliche-zustellungen/).

## Contact the Ausländerbehörde

The *Ausländerbehörde* is really hard to contact. They removed emails and fax numbers from their website. You must use the **[contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact)**.[^26]

To contact the *Ausländerbehörde*...

1. **Use the contact form**  
    Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments) to contact your department. Do not email or fax the *Ausländerbehörde*.
3. **Wait a few weeks**  
    The *Ausländerbehörde* [takes weeks or months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to answer.

### Fax the Ausländerbehörde

**Fax does not work.**[^13] Do not fax the *Ausländerbehörde*. It's not better or faster. Use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-departments).

## Sue the Ausländerbehörde

After you submit your residence permit application, the *Ausländerbehörde* has 3 months to make a decision. If you don't get an answer after 3 months, you can sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction.[^9] This is called an *Untätigkeitsklage nach [§ 75 VwGO](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwgo/__75.html)*. Usually, it makes them move faster.[^21] 

In most cases, the state pays for your legal expenses. In other cases, it costs around 400€, because the *Ausländerbehörde* reacts without going to court. An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can help you do this.
