Before you [visit](/guides/visit-berlin) or [move to Germany](/guides/moving-to-berlin), check if your devices work with German power outlets.

## German power socket type

German houses have **Type F** power outlets.[^0] They're also called Schuko or CEE 7/3 sockets. This is the same socket as in [most European countries](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_current_European_mains_electricity_plug_types.png), and many Asian countries.

[CEE 7/4 and 7/17 "Shuko" plug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuko) work in German power outlets:

[CEE 7/16 Europlugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europlug) also work in German power outlets:

CEE 7/7 plugs also work in German wall sockets:

## German power socket voltage

Germany has **230 Volt, 50 Hz** power sockets. If your country uses the same voltage and frequency, you just need a [travel adapter](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B077WJYNQ5?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1LOVV7QM7NBTJ&keywords=travel+adapter&qid=1669108574&sprefix=travel+adapte,aps,185&sr=8-46&linkCode=sl1&tag=kickawishl-20&linkId=cb722478ecf6e50fc5ffd79893de3d44&language=de_DE&ref_=as_li_ss_tl).

![Travel adapters](/images/travel-adapters.jpg "If your device accepts a 230V, 50Hz input, you just need a travel adapter.")

If your country uses a different voltage or frequency, check if your devices support 230V, 50Hz input. This information is always written on the charger.

If your charger does not support 230V, 50Hz, you need a [travel adapter with a voltage converter](https://www.amazon.com/-/en/dp/B0B7DL6SF2?keywords=travel+voltage+converter&qid=1669108317&sr=8-6&returnFromLogin=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=kickawishl-20&linkId=e7a51daa121e7f46af38907643345d14&language=de_DE&ref_=as_li_ss_tl). They are bigger and more expensive.
