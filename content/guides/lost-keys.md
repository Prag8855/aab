Locking yourself out happens to everyone. This guide shows you how to get back into your apartment, and what to do if you can't find your keys.

## If you lost your keys

If your keys were lost or stolen, you must **inform your landlord**.[^5] [Look for your old keys](/guides/lost-and-found-berlin) or [make new copies](/guides/key-copies).

The landlord might want to change all the locks in the building, to prevent theft. Usually, [you don't have to pay for this](#do-i-need-to-pay-to-replace-the-locks).

## If you locked yourself out

If you are locked out of your apartment, you must **call a locksmith** (*Schlüsseldienst*). It should cost 50€ to 150€ to open a door, depending on the the time. Locksmiths charge more at night and during the weekend.

When you call a locksmith, **ask for a fixed price**. Call multiple locksmiths if needed. Many dishonest locksmiths give one price, but add lots of special fees. After they opened the door, they ask for a much higher price.[^0]

I used [Albert Schlüsseldienst](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cg9FMAuMY3rCwpj88) 3 times in the past. They charged 50€ to 90€ to open a door.[^4] [AS Schlüsseldienst](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ycoJ8YEV9bhtmQo37) is often recommended too.

After the locksmith opens your door, you must prove that you live there. You can show your passport or your *[[Meldebescheinigung]]*.

**Ask for a receipt** and keep it. Your household insurance (*[[Hausratversicherung]]*) might cover the cost of calling a locksmith. For example, [Feather](/out/feather-hausrat)'s household insurance covers locksmiths,[^1] and they speak English. Liability insurance (*[[Haftpflichtversicherung]]*) does not cover this.

## Do I need to pay to replace the locks?

If you lose your keys, the landlord might want to change all the locks in the building to prevent theft. This costs thousands of euros. **Usually, you don't need to pay for this.**

You only pay to replace the locks if...

- **It's your fault**  
    If you lost your keys, it's your fault. If your keys were stolen, it's not your fault.[^11] If it's not your fault, you must not pay anything.
- and **there is a reason to change the locks**  
    Your landlord only needs to change the locks if there is a risk of theft or misuse. For example, if your keys fell in a lake, nothing can happen. If someone finds your keys, but they can't find where you live, nothing can happen.[^10] If nothing can happen, there is no reason to change the locks, so you don't need to pay. If your lease says that they must always change the locks, ignore it.[^8]
- and **the landlord changes the locks**  
    You must only pay for the cost of changing the locks. If the landlord does not do anything, you do not pay anything.[^6] The landlord can't fine you for losing keys.

Your [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) might cover the cost of changing the locks.[^9] Use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-haftpflicht) to compare liability insurance prices. [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht) and [Getsafe](/out/getsafe-haftpflicht) sell liability insurance that covers lost keys, and they speak English.

**[How to choose liability insurance ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

## When you move out

When you [move out](/guides/moving-out), you must give all your keys back, including the copies that you have made.[^2] If some keys are missing, your landlord can charge you to replace the keys. They can use your *[[Kaution]]* to pay for it.

## Other good advice

- [ ] **Check if someone found your keys**  
    If your keys are lost or stolen, you might be able to get them back. [This guide](/guides/lost-and-found-berlin) explains how to find your lost keys.
- [ ] **Give a key to a trusted friend**  
    If you lock yourself out, you can call your friend instead of a locksmith.
- [ ] **Get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung)**  
    It covers the cost of replacing all the locks, and it costs less than 5€ per month. Liability insurance is the most important insurance to have - 85% of Germans have it.[^3] [This guide](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung) explains why it's so important. [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht) and [Getsafe](/out/getsafe-haftpflicht) sell liability insurance for under 5€ per month. They cover lost keys for rented apartments, and they speak English.
- [ ] **Get [household insurance](/glossary/Hausratversicherung)**  
    Some policies cover the cost of a locksmith. Use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-hausrat) to find other household insurance that cover locksmiths.
