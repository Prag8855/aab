## How to buy the Deutschland Ticket

You can buy a Deutschland Ticket from many different apps. You can't buy it from a ticket machine. It's only sold as a monthly subscription. The subscription renews automatically until you cancel it.

The Deutschland Ticket always **starts on the first day of the month**.[^3] This means that if you need a ticket from January 10 to February 5, you must pay for two full months.

**I recommend [mo.pla](https://en.mopla.solutions/en/tickets/deutschlandticket)**, because it accepts more payment options, and it's the easiest to cancel. Their app is only on the German app store, but you can use their web app and download your ticket as a PDF.

### For tourists

Tourists should **get a ticket from [deutschland-ticket.store](https://deutschland-ticket.store/)**. It's the easiest option because it cancels automatically.[^5] Your ticket is a printable QR code. It takes a few days to process, so buy it in advance.[^1]

**The other option is [mo.pla](https://en.mopla.solutions/en/tickets/deutschlandticket)**, because it's also easy to cancel. Their app is only on the German app store, but you can use their web app instead. You can get a digital ticket in the app, or a printable ticket.

Other options require a European bank account, and are harder to cancel.

It can be easier to buy a regular daily, weekly or monthly ticket. You can buy them from a ticket machine at the train station. You can pay with cash or credit cards.
