Your mental health is important. It's also important to get help in your language. Below is a list of psychiatrists and psychotherapists who speak English in Berlin. This list is compiled from different sources, but it's still incomplete. If a therapist is missing from our list, [let me know](/suggest-therapist).

**The list is [at the bottom of this page](#places-map).**

## Psychiatrist or psychotherapist?

In Germany, psychiatrists are doctors, and they can prescribe medication. Psychotherapists can only perform therapy with their patients. There are much stricter requirements to become a psychiatrist, so there are fewer of them. If you need *therapy*, see a psychotherapist. If you need *medication*, see a psychiatrist.

[A guide to psychotherapy in Germany](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279513/) - US Embassy in Germany

## How hard is it to find a psychotherapist?

It can be very hard. It's much harder if you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), because many therapists only accept self-pay. Private health insurance usually refunds self-pay therapy, but public health insurance rarely does.

With public health insurance, it can take time to find an English-speaking therapist.[^0] If you are lucky, it will take a week. If you are not lucky, it will take months.

## How much does psychotherapy cost?

In Berlin, it costs around 100€ per hour.[^0] Group therapy can be cheaper.

**If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**, find a therapist that accepts public insurance. Your insurance will cover the therapy. You don't have to pay anything.

**If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**, your insurance will usually refund the costs. Check with your health insurer first, just to be sure.

**If you are a student**, you can also get free therapy [from your *Studentenwerk*](https://www.stw.berlin/en/counselling.html#jump_psychological_counselling).
