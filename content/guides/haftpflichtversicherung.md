If you cause an accident in Germany, you can be sued by the victim. If the victim wins, you will have to pay reparations.[^0] This could easily ruin you.

Liability insurance (*[[Haftpflichtversicherung]]*) protects you from such damage claims. If you cause an accident, your insurance company covers the legal fees and the reparations.

## What does liability insurance cover?

### Private liability insurance

Personal liability insurance (*Privathaftpflichtversicherung*) protects you from most claims against you:[^1]

- **Damage you cause to the apartment you rent** (doors, floors and walls, but not your own things)  
    For example, if your washing machine breaks, floods the apartment you rent, and destroys the wooden floor, the insurance company will pay the repairs.
- **Damage you cause to other people's property**  
    If you accidentally send someone a virus that breaks their computer, or scratch someone's car with your bicycle,[^2] they can sue you for damages. The insurance company will pay the legal fees and the reparations.
- **Damage caused by your spouse and children**  
    Liability insurance covers your family too, except your children under 7 years old.[^3] Your children over 6 years old are covered until they finish their studies.[^4]
- **Injuries caused to other people**  
    If you accidentally trip someone and they break their leg, they can sue you for damages. The insurance company will pay the legal fees and the reparations.

Some insurance policies will cover these accidents:

- **Lost keys**  
    If you lose your apartment keys, the landlord might need to [replace the locks for the entire building](/guides/lost-keys#do-i-need-to-pay-to-replace-the-locks).[^5] This can get *really* expensive. You should get insurance that covers this. Some leases require liability insurance that covers lost keys, but that's not legal.[^28]
- **Damage to things you rent or borrow** (*geliehene Sachen*)  
    For example, you break the couch in your furnished apartment,[^6] you damage a hotel room while you are on vacation,[^7] or you borrow a neighbour's drill and you break it.[^8]
- **Damage while helping a friend** (*Gefälligkeitsschäden*)  
    If you help your friend to move, and you break their furniture, liability insurance will not pay for it.[^9] Some new liability insurance policies cover this.[^10]
- **Other people's insurances not paying you** (*Forderungsausfall*)  
    If someone else hurts you, and they cannot pay the damages, your liability insurance will pay you.

Most insurance policies do not cover these accidents:

- **Damage to your own things**  
    The things you have in your apartment are not covered by the liability insurance. If you want to insure your furniture, your electronics or your bicycle, you need a household insurance (*[[Hausratversicherung]]*).[^11] Liability insurance covers damage to a rented apartment, but not to an apartment that you own. It still covers damage to your neighbours' apartments.
- **Damage caused by your business activities**  
    If you are a freelancer or a business owner, you will need professional liability insurance (*Betriebshaftpflichtversicherung*) to cover your business activities.
- **Damage caused by children under 7 years old**  
    Your young children are not covered by most liability insurances.[^3] You must pay more for this. Your children over 6 years old are covered by your liability insurance until they finish their studies.[^4]
- **Damage or injuries caused by your pets**  
    This is covered by a separate dog liability insurance (*[[Hundehaftpflichtversicherung]]*). It's required for all dog owners in Berlin, Brandenburg, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Thuringia.
- **Car accidents**  
    If you drive a car, damage to other people and their cars is covered by your [car insurance](/guides/car-insurance-germany), not by your personal liability insurance.
- **Legal disputes**  
    If *you* want to sue someone, your liability insurance won't protect you. [Legal insurance](/guides/legal-insurance) (*[[Rechtsschutzversicherung]]*) can be useful.
- **Piracy and copyright infringement**  
    If you get in trouble for [illegally downloading movies](/guides/pirating-streaming-movies-in-germany), your liability insurance will not cover you.[^12]
- **Locking yourself out**  
    If you lock yourself out of your apartment, and you call a locksmith to open the door, your liability insurance will not pay for it.[^32] Household insurance (*[[Hausratversicherung]]*) sometimes covers locksmiths. [Muffin](/out/muffin-hausrat) sells household insurance that covers locksmiths, and they speak English.

## Do I really need it?

**Yes**. Liability insurance is not mandatory, but it's a *really* good idea.[^2] There is no limit on damage claims. You can be sued for millions of euros.[^14] A tiny mistake can bankrupt you, and a cheap insurance can prevent this.[^15]

83% of German homes have liability insurance.[^16] It's the most important type of insurance after [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung).

## How much does it cost?

It usually costs **less than 5€ per month**, or around 60€ per year. You can pay less if you get multiple insurances from the same company.

Use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-haftpflicht) to compare liability insurance prices.

## How to pick liability insurance

**Don't just pick the cheapest insurance**, and don't trust sponsored posts from random websites. You might regret it when you need to use your insurance. Instead, do your own research.

1. **Use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-haftpflicht) to compare prices**  
    Tarifcheck only shows you the prices. It does not help you pick a *good* liability insurance.
2. **Use Test.de's [liability insurance checker](https://schnellcheck.test.de/haftpflichtversicherung/)**  
    This tool checks if your liability insurance covers the important things.
3. **Check your insurance company on [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/)**  
    See if people have problems getting paid by the insurance company.
4. **Read your insurance policy**  
    All EU insurance policies come with an Insurance Product Information Document ([[IPID]]).[^17] This one-page summary tells you what your liability insurance covers. Then you should read your entire contract. It takes less than an hour, and it's really worth it. If you don't speak German, [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht), [GetSafe](/out/getsafe-haftpflicht) and [Luko](/out/luko-haftpflicht) have their contracts in English.

### The minimum coverage you need

Your liability insurance must cover you well. This is the minimum it should cover:

- **Minimum insured sum**  
    These are the minimum sums a good liability insurance should cover.
    - At least 10 million euros[^18] in damages to other people. 50 million euros is better.[^19]
    - At least 300,000€ in damages to the apartment you rent.[^20]
    - At least 50,000€ in damages while using a computer.[^20]
- **Worldwide coverage**  
    It should cover you anywhere in the world, not just in Germany.[^20]
- **Coverage for rented things** (*geliehene Sachen*)  
    If you rent a furnished apartment, it should cover rented things. This covers you if you break the furniture.

Use [this tool](https://schnellcheck.test.de/haftpflichtversicherung/) to check if your liability insurance covers these things. Use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-haftpflicht) to filter liability insurances by feature.

I recommend liability insurance that covers lost keys. [Replacing a lost key](/guides/lost-keys#replacing-lost-keys-in-germany) can be very expensive. The landlord could make you pay to [replace all the locks in the building](/guides/lost-keys#do-i-need-to-pay-to-replace-the-locks). Most liability insurances cover this.

If you often rent vehicles, you can pay around 1€/month more to cover rented vehicles. This covers the car rental company's deductible if you damage the car.

### How to pay less

Don't get the cheapest insurance. Pick good coverage with a good insurance company. There are other ways to pay less.

- **Yearly payments** are cheaper than monthly payments[^21]
- **Combine liability and [household insurance](/glossary/Hausratversicherung)** to get a lower price.[^22]
- **Choose a higher deductible** (*[[Selbstbeteiligung]]*). If your deductible is higher, your insurance is cheaper. The price difference is small, so it's better to pay more, and have a small deductible.[^23]
- **Declare it on your [tax return](/glossary/Steuererklärung)**. Liability insurance payments are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).[^24]

### English-speaking insurers

If you don't speak German, pick an English-speaking insurer. [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht), [GetSafe](/out/getsafe-haftpflicht), and [Luko](/out/luko-haftpflicht) sell liability insurance, and they speak English. [Muffin](/out/muffin-haftpflicht) is sells liability insurance from multiple companies, and they speak English.

You must understand your insurance contract. It's important. [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht) has most of its contracts in English. [GetSafe](/out/getsafe-haftpflicht) only has the summary in English, not the contract.

You can also talk to an English-speaking insurance broker. They will help you pick the best liability insurance. Choose an *independent* insurance broker. They will recommend products from different insurers. For liability insurance, it's less important.

### My personal choice

I have liability insurance with [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht), but I have not used it yet. I chose them for a few reasons:

- Their liability insurance meets all the requirements above.
- They speak English. Even their insurance contract is in English. I like the convenience.
- They helped me get [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) before. I trust their services.
- I know their founder since many years, and meet him regularly. I trust him.
- They are a German company, based in Berlin.

## Other types of liability insurance

### Professional liability insurance

Professional liability insurance (*Betriebs-* and *Berufshaftpflichtversicherung*) protects freelancers, tradesmen and businesses against liability claims. Your insurance will protect you from liability claims related to your job.

If you are an employee, you do not need professional liability insurance. You are already covered by your employer's insurance.[^25]

Some professions are required to have liability insurance:[^26]

- Freelance doctors and veterinarians
- Architects
- Civil engineers
- Lawyers
- Tax advisors, tax agents, tax consultancy services[^27]

### Dog liability insurance

Dog liability insurance (*[[Hundehaftpflichtversicherung]]*) is required in Berlin, Brandenburg, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Thuringia. This insurance pays for the damages caused by your dog. It's sometimes called pet liability insurance (*Tierhaftpflichtversicherung*) or pet owner liability insurance (*Tierhalterhaftpflichtversicherung*).

*Hundehaftpflichtversicherung* costs around 5€ per month. Use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-dogs) to compare prices. If you don't speak German, [Feather](/out/feather-dogs), [GetSafe](/out/getsafe-dogs) and [Luko](/out/luko-dogs) sell dog liability insurance, and they speak English. They cover dangerous breeds.

### Liability insurance for drivers

When you drive a vehicle, you are covered by your car's insurance (*Kfz-Haftpflichtversicherung*). All cars in Germany must be insured. When you rent a car, liability insurance is included in the price.

**[More about car insurance in Germany ➞](/guides/car-insurance-germany)**

### Legal insurance

[Legal insurance](/guides/legal-insurance) (*[[Rechtsschutzversicherung]]*) gives you free access to a lawyer. If you have a problem with your landlord, your employer, the tax office or anyone else, you can call a lawyer. You can ask them questions, they can write letters for you, and they can go to court with you. Legal insurance will pay for it.

There is private legal insurance (for you), and professional legal insurance (for your business). Private legal insurance costs 16€ to 24€ per month.[^29] Professional legal insurance is more expensive. The price depends on what type of business you run.

[Muffin](/out/muffin-rechtsschutz) can help you choose legal insurance, and they speak English. [Feather](/out/feather-rechtsschutz) and [GetSafe](/out/getsafe-rechtsschutz) sell legal insurance, and they speak English. [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-rechtsschutz) lets you compare insurances, but it's only in German.

## Other questions

### Is liability insurance mandatory?

**No**. You are not required to have liability insurance, but it's a really good idea to have it. Most Germans have it.

- **If you have a dog** in Berlin, Brandenburg, Hamburg, Lower Saxony or Thuringia, you must have [dog liability insurance](/guides/pet-ownership#dog-liability-insurance).
- **If you have a car or a motorcycle**, then you must have [vehicle insurance](/guides/car-insurance-germany). It includes liability insurance for when you are driving.
- **In some professions**, you must have professional liability insurance.

### Can the landlord force me to get liability insurance?

**No.** The landlord can't force you to get liability insurance.[^30] If your lease has a clause that requires liability insurance, you can ignore it.[^31]
