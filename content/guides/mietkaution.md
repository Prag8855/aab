Before you [move into an apartment](/guides/moving-in) in Germany, you must give the landlord a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). The landlord keeps that deposit until you move out. If you leave the apartment in good condition, you get the whole deposit back. If something must be repaired, the landlord uses your deposit to pay for the repairs.

In this guide, I tell you how the deposit works, and how to get your deposit back.

## How much is the Kaution?

The *[Mietkaution](/glossary/Kaution)* is **usually 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete)**.[^12] It's the maximum landlords can ask for.[^0] Some landlords ask for a smaller deposit.

### Short-term rentals

**The rules are the same** for furnished apartments and short-term rentals.[^13] The *Kaution* is sometimes smaller for temporary apartments,[^1] but it can also be 3 times the [cold rent](/glossary/Kaltmiete).

## When do I pay the Kaution?

**Before your lease starts**. You don't need to send the money immediately after you sign the lease. You can wait until the day before your lease starts. This helps you [avoid apartment scams](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#common-apartment-scams).

**[How to move into an apartment](/guides/moving-in)** - explains the order of things

## What if I don't have enough money?

The *Kaution* is a lot of money. You get it back later, but you can't touch it during that time. If you don't have the money right now, there are other ways to pay your *Kaution*.

### Pay your Kaution in instalments

You have the right to pay your deposit in 3 parts:[^2] 1/3 of the deposit before you [move in](/guides/moving-in), 1/3 before the end of the first month, and 1/3 before the end of the second month.[^12] The landlord can't force you to pay the *Kaution* all at once.[^3]

### Pay with a Mietaval

If you don't have enough money to pay the deposit, you can also open a *[[Mietaval]]*. The bank guarantees the deposit for you, and you pay a small fee to the bank every month.

### Get help from the Jobcenter

If you receive [[ALG I]] or [[ALG II]], the Jobcenter will also pay your *Kaution*.[^4]

## What if I don't have a bank account?

You can pay the deposit with cash, or by bank transfer. Most people pay by bank transfer. You can send money from any bank account that allows [SEPA transfers](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung), not just German banks. You can also use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to send money from another country. I have used Wise many times.

You will still need a bank account for other things, so you should [open a German bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany) anyway.

## Where does my Kaution go?

Your deposit will go in a savings account called a *Mietkautionskonto*. The landlord can't use your deposit money. If you earn interest on that money, it belongs to you, not to the landlord.[^12] You can also agree with the landlord to invest the money somewhere else.

## When do I get my Kaution back?

**Usually, less than 6 months after you [move out](/guides/moving-out)**.[^5] The landlord must return your *Kaution* in a reasonable time.[^6] There is no legal limit, but 6 months is normal.[^7] It should not take more than 6 months without a good reason.

The landlord usually keeps your *Kaution* until they know how much utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*) you used. Sometimes, you used more water and heating than expected, and you must pay more. The utilities bill is adjusted once per year, with the *[[Nebenkostenabrechnung]]*.

After you get the utilities bill (*[[Nebenkostenabrechnung]]*), and everything in the *Übergabeprotokoll* is repaired, the landlord must give your deposit back. They have no other reason to keep your deposit.[^7]

If your rent is reduced while you live somewhere, you will get part of your *Kaution* back. That's because the *Kaution* can't be more than 3 times the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*).[^7]

## Will I get all of my Kaution back?

This depends on the condition of the apartment. If the landlord has to make repairs, they will use your deposit to pay for them. They can't make you pay to fix normal wear and tear.[^8] They can't make you pay for damage that was already there when you [moved in](/guides/moving-in).[^14]

If you don't return all the keys, the landlord can make you pay for missing keys. If you lost some keys, the landlord can [sometimes](/guides/lost-keys#do-i-need-to-pay-to-replace-the-locks) change all the locks in the building, and make you pay for it. This can be *very* expensive. They can use your *Kaution* to pay for it. If you have [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung), it will pay for this.[^15] That's why [you should have liability insurance](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung).

**[What happens when you lose apartment keys ➞](/guides/lost-keys)**

When you give back the apartment keys (the *Wohnungsübergabe*), you fill a handover document ([*Übergabeprotokoll*](/glossary/%C3%9Cbergabeprotokoll)). In this document, you describe the condition of the apartment, and what needs to be repaired.

After you move out, the landlord has 6 months to find what must be repaired<sup>[1](https://www.welt.de/welt_print/article3917551/Ohne-Grund-kann-der-Vermieter-die-Kaution-nicht-einbehalten.html), [§548 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__548.html)</sup>. After 6 months, they can't find more things to repair.

When you move out, always fill an *Übergabeprotokoll*. The landlord can't charge you for problems that are not in this document.[^16]

**The landlord can only use your deposit to make repairs or pay your debts**.[^9] They can't keep your *Kaution* to punish you. If they make repairs, they must give you a detailed invoice with the cost of repairs.[^10] They must show receipts for everything.[^11] They can't charge you for things they do not repair.[^11]

## My landlord won't return my Kaution

If your landlord won't return your deposit, you can get help from your [tenants' association](/glossary/Mieterverein) or a [lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin). Conny also offers a [deposit recovery service](/out/conny-kaution). You only pay if they are successful.
