## Relocation agency or immigration lawyer?

**Relocation consultants** help you [move to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin) and deal with German bureaucracy, but they can't give legal advice.

**Immigration lawyers** give legal advice. They only help you with immigration: residence permits, permanent residence and citizenship. If you have legal questions, you need a lawyer.
