## Is recreational marijuana legal?

**Yes, recreational marijuana is legal** since April 1, 2024. There are many restrictions:[^15]

**Who** can smoke:

- You must be at least 18 years old to have or grow cannabis.[^5]

**What** you can possess:

- You can have up to **25 grams on you**, and **50 grams at home**.[^12]
- You can grow up to **3 plants at home**. 3 plants per person, not per household. You can't sell the cannabis that you grow.[^6]
- You can't give the cannabis you grow to other people, not even for free.[^10]

**Where** you can smoke:

- You can't smoke around people who are under 18 years old.[^7]
- You can't smoke in pedestrian zones between 7:00 and 20:00.[^9]
- You can't smoke within sight of schools, kindergartens, playgrounds, sports facilities and cannabis clubs.[^9] You can smoke if you are out of sight of the entrances, or more than 100 metres away.

There is currently **no way to buy weed**. There are no cannabis stores. You must grow it yourself or join a [cannabis club](#cannabis-clubs).

### Cannabis clubs

**You can't buy weed** from a store. To buy weed, you must join a cannabis club.

Rules for cannabis clubs:[^17]

- You must become a member of a cannabis club to get cannabis.
- You can only be a member of 1 cannabis club.[^25]
- Clubs are non-profit organisations, and need permission to operate.
- Clubs can have up to 500 members.[^24]
- Clubs can give members 25 grams of cannabis per day, or 50 grams per month.[^20]
- Clubs can give members under 22 years old 30 grams of cannabis per month.[^21]
- You can't share the weed from cannabis clubs with other people.[^22]
- Clubs can only sell cannabis flowers, not cannabis products.[^19]
- Clubs can't ship or deliver cannabis.[^23]
- Clubs can't advertise or sponsor.[^11]

To join a club, you must...[^18]

- Be at least 18 years old
- Be a resident for at least 6 months[^26]

At the moment, it's almost impossible to join a club. There are almost no approved clubs, and the existing clubs have long waiting lists.[^29] It could take a few months before you can easily buy weed from a club.{{ fail_on('2025-06-01') }}

### Is medicinal marijuana legal?

**Yes**. Medical marijuana is legal. It is rarely prescribed. Only a few hundred people have a prescription.[^1] With legalisation, it became easier to prescribe.[^8]

### Is CBD legal?

**It depends.** Cannabis flowers are legal, but processed cannabis is illegal.

Before legalisation, processed CBD products with less than 0.2% THC were legal.[^2] CBD oil with less than 0.2% THC was legal.[^3] It should still be the case. The rules after legalisation are not clear yet.

You can find CBD flowers in some *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* and head shops.[^4]

## Are cannabis seeds legal?

**Yes.** Cannabis seeds are legal. You can also buy seeds from other EU countries.[^14]

### Are HHC and THCP legal?

The sale of Hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and Tetrahydrocannabiphorol (THCP) is banned since June 2024.[^16] Possession is still legal. You might still find HHC edibles, cartridges and flowers online, in some [Spätis](/glossary/Späti) and in some head shops.[^28]{{ fail_on('2025-07-31')}}

## Can I bring weed from another country?

**No.** For example, you can't buy weed in the Netherlands, and bring it to Germany. They sometimes check buses, trains and cars that come from the Netherlands.[^13] They sometimes use dogs to detect drugs.

This might have changed with legalisation, but it's not confirmed.
