{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Is recreational marijuana legal?

**Yes.** Recreational marijuana is legal since April 1.{{ fail_on('2024-12-01')}} There are many restrictions:[^15]

- You must be at least 18 years old to have cannabis.[^5]
- You can have up to **25 grams on you**, and **50 grams at home**.
- You can grow up to **3 plants at home**. 3 plants per person, not per household.
- You can't smoke within 100 metres of schools, kindergartens, playgrounds and sports facilities. Between 7:00 and 20:00, you can't smoke in the pedestrian zones of city centres.
- Cannabis can't have more than 10% THC. The average is around 15%.[^16]

There is currently **no way to buy weed**. There are no cannabis stores. You must grow it yourself or join a [cannabis club](#cannabis-clubs).

**Things can still change.** Legalisation is very recent. Some laws are still unclear, and every state can implement them differently. I will update this guide when we get more answers.

### Cannabis clubs

**You can't buy weed from a store.** To buy weed, you must join a cannabis club. Clubs can start growing cannabis on July 1 2024.

The rules for cannabis clubs:[^17]

- You must become a member of a cannabis club to get cannabis.
- Clubs can have up to 500 members.
- Clubs can give members 25 grams of cannabis per day, or 50 grams per month.
- Clubs can give members under 22 years old 30 grams of cannabis per month.
- Clubs can't advertise.

To join a club, you must...[^18]

- Be at least 18 years old
- Be a resident for at least 6 months

### Is medicinal marijuana legal?

**Yes**. Medical marijuana is legal. It is rarely prescribed. Only a few hundred people have a prescription.[^1] With legalisation, it became easier to prescribe.[^8]

### Is CBD legal?

**It depends.** Cannabis flowers are legal, but processed cannabis is illegal.

Before legalisation, processed CBD products with less than 0.2% THC were legal.[^2] CBD oil with less than 0.2% THC was legal.[^3] It should still be the case. The rules after legalisation are not clear yet.

You can find CBD flowers in some *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* and head shops.[^4]

## Are cannabis seeds legal?

**Yes.** Cannabis seeds are legal.

You can buy cannabis seeds on the internet. [Royal Queen Seeds](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/) and [Samenwahl](https://www.samenwahl.com/) are popular options from other countries.[^7] Websites like [Royal Queen Seeds](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/) and [Samenwahl](https://www.samenwahl.com/) accept payment in bitcoins.

People already seeds without problems before legalisation, but German customs sometimes seized cannabis seeds sent by post.[^9] [Sensi Seeds](https://sensiseeds.com/) stopped shipping seeds to Germany because of this.[^10] The people who ordered the seeds got a letter from the police. They are not in big trouble, but they might need to hire a lawyer.[^11]

## Can I bring weed from another country?

**No.** For example, you can't buy weed in the Netherlands, and bring it to Germany. They sometimes check buses, trains and cars that come from the Netherlands.[^13] They sometimes use dogs to detect drugs.

It's a lot easier to buy quality weed in the Netherlands, or even in the Czech Republic, but it's risky to bring it back to Germany.

## Where can I buy weed in Berlin?
