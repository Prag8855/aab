## Is recreational marijuana legal?

**Not yet.** Recreational marijuana is illegal in Germany. **It will become legal on April 1 2024**.

**[More about legalisation ↓](#legalisation-on-april-1)**

In Berlin, cannabis is tolerated. People often smoke weed in parks, on the street, and even in some bars. If you smoke weed, people usually leave you alone. The police usually ignores it. It's different in other German states.

### Is medicinal marijuana legal?

**Yes**. Medical marijuana is legal for seriously ill patients with a prescription[^0] since 2017. It is rarely prescribed. Only a few hundred people have a prescription.[^1]

### Is CBD legal?

**It depends.** CBD flowers are not legal for consumers. Processed CBD products are legal if they have less than 0.2% THC.[^2] CBD oil with less than 0.2% THC is legal.[^3]

You can still find CBD flowers in some *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* and head shops,[^4] even if it's illegal.

## Legalisation on April 1

**Cannabis becomes legal on April 1.** The new rules will be...[^15]

- Only adults can have cannabis
- You can have up to **25 grams on you**, and **50 grams at home**
- You can grow up to **3 plants at home**. 3 plants per person, not per household.
- You can't smoke within 100 metres of schools, kindergartens, playgrounds and sports facilities. Between 7:00 and 20:00, you can't smoke in the pedestrian zones of city centres.
- Cannabis can't have more than 10% THC. The average is around 15%.[^16]

There is **no way to buy weed directly**. There are no cannabis stores. You must grow it yourself or join a [cannabis club](#cannabis-clubs).

### Cannabis clubs

Stores will not sell weed. To buy weed, you must join a cannabis club. They can start growing cannabis on July 1 2024.

The rules for cannabis clubs:[^17]

- You must become a member of a cannabis club to get cannabis.
- Clubs can have up to 500 members.
- Clubs can give members 25 grams of cannabis per day, or 50 grams per month.
- Clubs can give members under 22 years old 30 grams of cannabis per month.

To join a club, you must...[^18]

- Be at least 18 years old
- Be a resident for at least 6 months

## Are cannabis seeds legal?

**No.** Cannabis seeds are legal if "they are not intended for unauthorized cultivation",[^5] and German authorities assume that you will grow cannabis.[^6]

You can buy cannabis seeds on the internet. [Royal Queen Seeds](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/) is a popular website.[^7] Websites like [Royal Queen Seeds](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/) and [Samenwahl](https://www.samenwahl.com/) accept payment in bitcoins.

Many people order seeds without problems,[^8] but it's still risky. In 2021, German customs seized cannabis seeds sent by post.[^9] [Sensi Seeds](https://sensiseeds.com/) stopped shipping seeds to Germany because of this.[^10] The people who ordered the seeds got a letter from the police. They are not in big trouble, but they might need to hire a lawyer.[^11]

## Can I grow my own weed?

**No.**[^12] You can't grow your own cannabis in Germany. It's illegal.

## Can I bring weed from another country?

**No.** For example, you can't buy weed in the Netherlands, and bring it to Germany. They sometimes check buses, trains and cars that come from the Netherlands.[^13] They sometimes use dogs to detect drugs.

It's a lot easier to buy quality weed in the Netherlands, or even in the Czech Republic, but it's risky to bring it back to Germany.

## What happens if I get caught with weed?

If you get caught with cannabis on you, the police will take you to the police station and question you. They will take your photo and information, and they will let you go. Be polite, and do what you are told. You will be fine.

A few weeks later, you will get a receipt for your visit at the police station. You don't need to do anything yet. At this point, your case is still open.

Later, you will either get a letter with legal instructions, or a letter that says that there is no trouble.

In Berlin, what happens depends on how much weed you have:[^14]{{ fail_on('2024-04-01') }}

- **Under 10 grams**  
    The public prosecutor's office *must* drop your case if there is no danger to others. You are not in trouble, unless you were driving while high, cycling while high, or smoking weed around children.
- **Under 15 grams**  
    The public prosecutor's office *can choose* to drop your case. You could be in trouble.
- **Over 15 grams**  
    The public prosecutor's office *must* prosecute your case. You are in trouble.

In all cases, this will appear on your record at the driver licence's office. It could be a problem when you try to get a German driving licence.
