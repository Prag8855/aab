This is an introduction to German banking for immigrants. It explains how bank accounts, credit cards and bank transfers work in Germany.

To choose a bank account, read my guide on **[how to choose a bank](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**.

## Bank accounts

In Germany, everyone has the right to a bank account. You need a bank account to get paid by your employer, pay your rent, pay taxes and buy things online. Many things are only paid by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung). You should open a bank account as soon as you arrive in Germany.

You can use a bank from another EU country. It will work fine in Germany.

### Types of bank accounts

Germans usually have 3 bank accounts:

- **A current account** (*Girokonto*) to pay for everyday things. It's a bad place to keep a lot of money, because it pays near 0% interest. People usually keep around 2,000€ in their *Girokonto*.
- **An instant savings account** (*Tagesgeldkonto*) to store money, but keep it easy to access. It pays 1% to 3% interest, and has zero risk.
- **A trading account** (*Depot*) to invest in stocks and ETFs.

When you [start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany), you should also have a separate bank account for your business.

Foreign students might need a blocking account (*Sperrkonto*) to get a residence permit.

## Common payment methods

Germans use 4 payment methods: bank transfers, cash, Girocard and Visa/Mastercard. Other payment methods are rarely used.

### Bank transfers

In the European Union, bank transfers are free. It's the **standard way to send money** to other people. Bank transfers take 1 to 3 days, but instant transfers are also possible. Some banks offer free instant transfers. Others charge a small fee like 0.50€.

A company can regularly take money from your bank account with a direct debit authorisation (*[[SEPA-Lastschriftmandat]]*). People often pay bills and taxes that way.

### Cash

Germans love cash. 58% of their transactions are paid with cash.[^3] They usually have around 100€ in their wallet, and use an ATM around 3 times per month.[^3]

Many restaurants only accept cash. Most street food kiosks and *[Spätis](/glossary/Sp%C3%A4ti)* only accept cash.

**Always have cash with you**. [Choose a bank](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany) with low ATM fees.

### Girocard/EC-Karte

A type of payment card that's only in Germany. It's still very common.[^3] Many stores only accept cash and Girocards, not Visa or Mastercard. A few websites accept Girocard.

Many banks don't offer Girocards. You don't really need one.[^1] If you can pay with Girocard, you can pay with cash.

### Visa and Mastercard

More and more businesses accept Visa and Mastercard, but you still need cash. Many restaurants and *[Spätis](/glossary/Späti)* only accept cash. Most websites accept Visa and Mastercard.

In Berlin, some government offices don't accept Visa or Mastercard.

### Other payment methods

Germans do not use checks or QR code payments. There is no system like Alipay, Cash App, Line Pay, UPI or WeChat Pay. American Express is very rare.[^2] Paypal is common for online purchases.[^3]

## Credit cards in Germany

Most bank accounts come with a Visa or Mastercard *debit* card. The card only works if there is money in your account.

Real credit cards are rare.[^3] Immigrants can rarely get one. You might get a very small limit like 500€.

Some bank accounts only include a **virtual card**. That means that you get a credit card number, an expiration code and CVV code, but you don't get a plastic card. You can only use it with Apple Pay, Google Pay or for online payments. You can usually get a plastic card for a small fee.

German credit cards rarely have **benefits** like cashback or points. Some cards have a yearly fee, and come with travel insurance. You can usually get separate travel insurance for cheaper.

## Banks in Germany

Online banks and offline banks

You can also use a bank in another EU country.
