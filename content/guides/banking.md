This is an introduction to German banking for immigrants. It explains how bank accounts, credit cards and bank transfers work in Germany.

To open a bank account, read my guide on **[how to choose a bank](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)**.

## Types of bank accounts

In Germany, everyone has the right to a bank account. Germans pay many things by bank transfer. You can't go far without a bank account. Opening a bank account is one of the first things you must do when you move to Germany.

Germans usually have 3 bank accounts:

- **A current account** (*Girokonto*) to pay for everyday things. It's a bad place to keep a lot of money, because it pays near 0% interest.
- **An instant savings account** (*Tagesgeldkonto*) to park money. It pays 1% to 3% interest, it has zero risk of losing money, and it's easy to access your money.
- **A stock account** (*Depot*) to invest in stocks and ETFs.

When you [start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany), you should also have a separate bank account for your business.

Foreign students might need a blocking account (*Sperrkonto*) to get a residence permit.

## Payment methods in Germany

Germans use 4 payment methods:

1. **Bank transfers**  
    You can transfer money to any account in Europe for free. Transfers take 1 to 3 days. You can pay a small fee (under 1€) for instant transfers. It's the common way to send a lot of money.
2. **Cash**  
    Germans use cash a lot. You must always carry cash on you, because cards are rarely accepted for small purchases (under 5€). Many restaurants only accept cash. Some only accept cards.
3. **Girocard/EC-Karte**  
    This type of payment card only works in Germany. Some stores don't accept Visa or Mastercard, but accept Girocards because they pay less fees. Some government offices only accept Girocards. Few websites accept Girocard, so you should have a Visa or Mastercard.
4. **Visa and Mastercard**  
    Most businesses accept Visa and Mastercard. Many restaurants and *[Spätis](/glossary/Späti)* only accept cash.

Germans do not use checks or QR code payments. They sometimes use Paypal.

Apple Pay and Google Pay is very common. Most credit card terminals accept it. Most banks have it.

## Credit cards

Most bank accounts come with a Visa or Mastercard *debit* card. The card only works if there is money in your account.

Real credit cards are harder to get, especially for recent immigrants. You might get a very small limit like 500€.

Some bank accounts only include a **virtual card**. That means that you get a credit card number, an expiration code and CVV code, but you don't get a plastic card. You can only use it with Apple Pay, Google Pay or for online payments. You can usually get a plastic card for a small fee.

German credit cards rarely have **benefits** like cashback or points. Some cards have a yearly fee, and come with travel insurance. You can usually get separate travel insurance for cheaper.
