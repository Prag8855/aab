The International Driving Permit is an official translation of your driver's licence. It is recognised in 200 countries.[^0] When you drive in other countries, you should carry it with your original driver's licence.

This guide applies to you if:

1. You live in Germany
2. You have a German driving licence
3. You want to drive in a country that requires an International Driving Permit

## With a German driver's licence

If you have a German driver's licence, you must [book a *Bürgeramt* appointment](/guides/berlin-burgeramt-appointment) for an *[Internationaler Führerschein](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/121591/)*. The ADAC does not issue International Driver Permits anymore.[^1]

You must bring 15€, a [biometric picture](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin) and a valid German driver's licence. Temporary licenses issued to new drivers (*vorläufiger Nachweis der Fahrerlaubnis*) are not accepted. You must bring a valid plastic driving licence (*Kartenführerschein*).

You will leave the *[[Bürgeramt]]* with a valid International Driving Permit. This permit is valid for 3 years.

## With a non-German driver's licence

The *[[Bürgeramt]]* only gives International Driving Permits for German driving licences. If you have a driver's licence from another country, you must follow different steps. In most cases, you must request the International Driving Permit in your country of origin.

- **Canada**: From the CAA, while in Canada. No other authority can issue them. You can [convert your licence to a German one](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence), then request an International Driving Permit in Germany.
- **United States:** The AAA can [mail International Driving Permits overseas](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html).
- **Great Britain:** From the [AA,](https://www.theaa.com/driving-advice/driving-abroad/idp) the [RAC](https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/travel/driving-in-europe/international-driving-permit/) or the [Post Office](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity/international-driving-permit). You can also [request a British IDP by post](https://www.theaa.com/driving-advice/driving-abroad/idp).
