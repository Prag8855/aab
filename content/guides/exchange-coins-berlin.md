This guide shows you how to deposit a lot of coins, or exchange them for euro bills. The German term is *Bargeldeinzahlung*.

## At your bank

You can deposit your coins at a deposit machine (*Einzahlautomat*). They are next to other cash machines, usually near the entrance of the bank. The money will go in your bank account.

- **Commerzbank**  
    You can use the Commerzbank coin machines for free. [Search for Commerzbank branches](https://filialsuche.commerzbank.de/) with *Einzahlautomaten.*
- **Comdirect**   
    You can use the Commerzbank coin machines for free.[^0] [Search for Commerzbank branches](https://filialsuche.commerzbank.de/) with *Einzahlautomaten.* You get 3 free deposits per month.[^1]
- **Deutsche Bank**  
    You can use the Deutsche Bank coin machines for free. [Search for Deutsche Bank branches](https://www.deutsche-bank.de/pk/filialsuche.html) with *Bargeldeinzahlung am Automaten*. If you deposit coins at the counter, you will pay a fee.[^2]
- **N26**  
    You can use [CASH26](https://n26.com/en-de/cash26) to deposit coins. You must roll your coins first. It's not a good way to deposit a lot of coins. [How CASH26 works.](https://n26.com/en-de/cash26) The fee is 1.5% of your deposit. It's better to return coins [at the *Bundesbank*](/guides/exchange-coins-berlin#at-the-bundesbank).
- **Sparkasse**   
    You can use the Sparkasse coin machines for free.[^3] [Search for Sparkasse branches](https://www.sparkasse.de/service/filialsuche.html) with an *Ein- und Auszahlungsautomat*. You also deposit coins at the counter for a 7.50€ fee.[^9] If you have a lot of coins, you might need many bags.[^4]

If your bank does not have branches in Berlin, you can deposit coins at the Bundesbank.

## At the Bundesbank

If you bring your coins to the federal bank (*Bundesbank*), they will exchange them for free.[^5] You will get euro bills in return. **This is the best way to exchange a lot of coins**.[^6]

1. Bring your coins to [the Bundesbank in Charlottenburg](https://goo.gl/maps/2YyBakZq5txYEsqq7). You don't need to roll your coins[^7].[^10] Just put them in a bag.
2. Take a number and wait until it's called. You don't need an appointment.
3. You will go in a small booth. They will give you a box. Put your coins in the box, and they will count them.
4. The employee will give you euro bills.

I have done this. It's very easy. You don't need to speak German.

## At Coinstar machines

There are Coinstar machines in many supermarkets. When you put your coins in a Coinstar machine, you get a coupon. Bring that coupon to the cashier. You can get money back, or use the coupon to pay for groceries.[^8]

**Coinstar machines have a 9.9% fee**.[^8] It's the most expensive way to exchange coins.
