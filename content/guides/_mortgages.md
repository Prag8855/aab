## Renting vs. buying in Germany

You might be asking yourself what the benefits of buying are, instead of just renting for long periods. Big cities like Berlin and Munich have seen a 20% increase in rental prices in just 7 years. With rental prices always on the rise, buying a property is quickly becoming a more desirable option.

It’s worth noting that rental prices can legally be raised by a maximum of 15% every 3 years. Meanwhile, interest rates on mortgages are very low – often even lower than rental prices. When purchasing a property, you also have the possibility of its value increasing over time.

## Home ownership costs in Germany

Before you consider buying a property, make yourself aware of the costs of home ownership. As a homeowner, you will be required to pay a quarterly property tax (*Grundsteuer*) which is dependent on the value dictated by your local tax office (*Finanzamt*). The property tax is generally no more than 150 € per quarter, based on 41 million German households.

If you’re buying an apartment, you have to calculate a monthly house fees (*Hausgeld*) for additional costs such as:

- Maintenance Reserve (*Instandhaltungsrücklage*)
- House Insurance (*Wohngebäudeversicherung*)
- Property Management (*Hausverwaltung*)
- Snow Removal (*Schneebeseitigung*)
- Waste/rubbish removal (*Müllabfuhr*)
- etc.

These are all to be paid to the property management company on a monthly basis. In addition to these house fees, you will also need to pay for heating and water costs as well as for electricity, internet and the [media license (*GEZ*)](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag).

## Qualifying for a mortgage

The first step you should take is finding out if you qualify for a mortgage. While your nationality isn’t likely to play a part in whether or not you qualify, your current working situation will very much influence the mortgage you could qualify for.

- **Residence Permit** To qualify for a German mortgage, you must have a German citizenship or a German permanent residence. Blue Cards, work visas or freelance visas will not be enough to qualify for a mortgage.
- **Employment Status** If you are employed full-time, have been working for your employer for more than 3 months, and are no longer in your probation period, you will qualify for a mortgage. If you are a freelancer, you need to prove that you had regular and sustainable income for the last 3 years, to show your financial stability.
- **Household Budget** In addition to your current employment status, you will need to have enough monthly income to both sustain your regular living expenditures and also be able to cover your future monthly mortgage payment. This is also known as the calculation of your household budget where your monthly mortgage payments should not be higher than 40% of your monthly income.
- **Down payment** Another crucial element in figuring out how large of a mortgage you can get from a German bank is to know how much of your own money you can invest. In general, you will need to have enough money to cover the closing costs that are associated with buying property in Germany. These costs include the real estate commission, notary fee, property transfer tax, and the land register fees. These fees can amount to as much as 15% of the property price and must always be paid from your own money.

To find out if you qualify for a mortgage and what interest rate you could get, you can make an appointment with a mortgage broker.

## Working with a mortgage broker

You could also apply for a mortgage with your house bank (e.g. [Deutsche Bank](https://www.financeads.net/tc.php?t=28713C15736755T), Sparkasse etc) but the house banks rarely offer the best mortgage conditions. Therefore, you should always compare with other banks because you can basically apply for a mortgage with any German bank. This is where an independent mortgage broker can be extremely helpful.

A mortgage broker will help you determine whether or not you qualify, how much you can afford to borrow, and advise you on which banks to apply to. You can calculate your own free affordability report [here](https://hypofriend.de/en/affordability/language/) to estimate how much you’ll be able to borrow from a German bank.

Another advantage of working with a broker is that they can help you get pre-approval for a mortgage from the bank. This will allow you to act quickly in securing the sale of your new home, as you’ll appear more reliable and trustworthy to sellers.

A broker will also assist you in getting your paperwork in order, which is incredibly important. There are a lot of documents you need to present in order to secure a loan, so it’s crucial that you prepare ahead of time.

## Finding the right mortgage for you

Before you get started, it’s important to think about your future. How long do you plan to live in the property? What are your plans when it comes to changing jobs or having children? Speaking with a mortgage advisor will help you get a better idea of your situation moving forward, and how it will affect your mortgage needs. From here, you can start thinking about which options best suit your needs.

It’s vital to remember that in Germany, cancelling a mortgage contract can be very expensive. If you want to cancel your mortgage within the first 10 years after purchasing your property, your bank will take make you pay a so-called prepayment penalty ("*Vorfälligkeitsentschädigung*"). German law always everybody with a mortgage to legally terminate their mortgage contract after 10,5 years and refinance with a different bank. This way you do not have to pay the penalty. If you decide to move away from Berlin but still have the mortgage, you could rent out your property to pay for your monthly mortgage rate.

Once you have given plenty of thought to your circumstances and how long you plan on living in the property, you should meet a mortgage broker and most importantly start gathering your documents.

### Documents the bank will need

German banks will require you to submit both personal documents and property documents. Here’s the list of documents you will need to have ready if you want to apply for a German mortgage:

**General documents for everybody:**

- Self-disclosure form (*Selbstauskunft*)
- Copy of your passport
- [Credit score certificate (Schufa)](/guides/schufa)
- Proof of your equity

**For employees only:**

- Salary slips for last 3 months
- Salary statement from last year

**For freelancers only (not required to prepare a balance sheet):**

- Current business evaluation
- Revenue surplus for last 2 years

**For self-employed business owners only:**

- Current sales statements
- Annual account statements for last 2 years *(“Betriebswirtschaftliche Auswertung” - BWA)*

**Property Documents**

In addition to the personal documents you will also need to provide specific documents about the property you are looking to buy. Once you have found the right property, you will need to gather the following property documents to fully qualify for a mortgage:

- Current extract of land register *(“Grundbuchauszug”)*
- Floor plan (*“Grundriss”*)
- Land register map *(“Flurkarte”)*
- Declaration of division *(“Teilungserklärung”)*
- Building description *(“Baubeschreibung”)*
- Draft of purchase agreement *(“Kaufvertragsentwurf”)*
- Current photos of the property

## Mortgage options in Germany

There are a lot of options when it comes to getting a mortgage but some are more popular than others. The most popular mortgage option in Germany is the annuity mortgage (*“Annuitätendarlehen”*). With this type of mortgage your monthly mortgage payment stays constant for the duration that you have fixed your mortgage for. This duration can range anywhere from 5 to 30 years. The most popular duration is to fix a mortgage for an initial 10 years. After the 10 years, most people will not have paid their entire mortgage which means that they will need to get a new mortgage to pay back their remaining mortgage. This is a common scenario for most people with a mortgage in Germany. To get a new mortgage, you can either stay with your existing bank or switch to another bank. You are free to choose.

In an annuity mortgage the annual rate you pay to your bank always stays the same. The annuity is split into 12 equal monthly payments. A monthly payment is made up of two components: the interest payment and the actual mortgage repayment to your bank. The benefit of the annuity mortgage is that you are sure to know what your future payments will be because the rate does not change every month.

In addition to the annuity mortgage, It’s also worth exploring your options with a state-funded mortgage (*“KfW Darlehen”*). These types of mortgages can be easily combined with annuity mortgages and offer below-market interest rates. Up to 50.000 € can be financed using a KfW mortgage, in addition to the annuity mortgage from the bank you choose.

People that are planning to buy an existing property and move in themselves or people who build their own house qualify for a KfW mortgage.

As with any financial product, it is worthwhile shopping around and checking which German bank offers the best interest rates.
