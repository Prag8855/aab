This is how you can find an English-speaking doctor or GP.

**The list is [at the bottom of this page](#list-of-doctors-and-gps).**

## Video call with a doctor

A video call is faster and easier than a doctor visit. It's a good way to get a [sick note](/glossary/Krankschreibung).

The [TeleClinic](https://www.teleclinic.com/) app let you schedule a video call with a doctor. It's only in German, but some doctors speak English.

This service is free. Your [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) pays for it. Your [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) reimburses it.
