## Other doctor databases

- [116117.de](https://www.116117.de/de/englisch.php#content1292)

The information on these websites can be inaccurate. Some doctors don't speak the language that they list.[^1]

Ask your health insurance too. [TK](/glossary/Techniker%20Krankenkasse) has a list of English-speaking doctors. They can even [book an appointment for you](https://www.tk.de/service/form/2028156/terminservice.form).

## Doctor hotlines

Call [116117](https://www.116117.de/de/englisch.php). They might not speak English.

This free hotline can:

- Tell you what to do if you feel sick
- Book a doctor appointment
- Book a doctor visit to your house

For emergencies, call [112](tel:112). They speak English.

## Video call with a doctor

A video call is faster and easier than a doctor visit. It's a good way to get a [sick note](/glossary/Krankschreibung).

The [TeleClinic](https://www.teleclinic.com/sick-note/) and [Doktor.de](https://doktor.de) apps let you schedule a video call with a doctor. It's only in German, but some doctors speak English.

This service is free. Your [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) pays for it. Your [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) reimburses it.
