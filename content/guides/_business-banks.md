In this guide, I explain what a business bank account (*Geschäftskonto*) is, why you need one, and how to choose one.

## What is a Geschäftskonto?

A *Geschäftskonto* is a bank account for your business. It's works exactly like a personal bank account.

Some business bank accounts extra features:

- Tools that sort transactions and make bookkeeping easier
- [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) reporting tools
- Extra credit cards and sub-accounts for your employees
- Integration with your accounting tools

## Why you need a business bank account

### Personal accounts are not for business

N26[^0], bunq[^1], and many other banks don't let you to use your personal bank account for your business[^2]. If you do this, the bank can close your account, because you don't follow their [terms of service](/glossary/AGB)[^3].

### It makes bookkeeping easier

You have one credit card for you, and another credit card for your business. Your personal transactions are in one place, and your business transactions are in another place. It makes bookkeeping much easier.

If you connect your bank account to your bookkeeping software, you only see business transactions. You don't need to filter hundreds of personal transactions.

### It's sometimes required

If you have a corporation or limited liability company (*GmbH*, *UG*, *AG* or *KGaA*), you *must* have a separate bank account for your business[^4].

Freelancers and sole proprietors do not need a business bank account[^5], but it's still a good idea.

### Costs and fees

If possible, choose a bank with low fees.

### German IBAN

Some banks will give you an IBAN in another EU country. IBAN discrimination is illegal, but it happens[^6]. Some clients might also wonder why your bank is in another country.

These banks give you a German IBAN:

### Anmeldung required

If you just [moved to Berlin](https://localhost/guides/moving-to-berlin), and you have not [registered your address](/glossary/Anmeldung), choose a bank that does not require a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung).

### Cash and coin payments

## What I use for my business

From 2017 to 2021, I used my personal [N26](/out/n26) account. [N26 Business](/out/n26-business) is exactly the same, but N26 doesn't let me have a personal account and a business account.

Since January 2022, I use [Kontist](/out/kontist). It's not great, so I don't recommend it.

## What's next?

Once you have a bank account, you need an invoicing and bookkeeping tool. You can also look for a tax advisor who can help you with taxes.
