## Before you start

### It's normal to feel lonely

**Everyone feels lonely in their first year.** It's a normal part of moving to a new city.

Your first friends might be nomads just like you. Many will leave, and it might hurt. **It gets easier with time.** You will meet people who choose to stay, just like you.

Berliners are not the friendliest strangers. It's normal to miss small talk and nice interactions. It gets better when you learn German, but you also get used to it. It just takes time.

Everyone feels lonely at first, but it gets better. You will slowly rebuild your social circle, discover new passions, meet new people. It just takes time and a bit of effort.

## How to meet people in Berlin

### Meetups

- **[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)** (free)  
    There are meetup groups for all kinds of hobbies, and just for meeting people. Many meetups are in English.
- **[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.de/)
- **[Facebook events](https://www.facebook.com/events/)**
