If you lived in Germany for a few years, you can become a permanent resident.

As a permanent resident, you can...

- Live in Germany
- Work, study and freelance without the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*'s permission
- Bring your family to Germany
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Why become a permanent resident

Permanent residence means **more stability**. It's better than a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) because...

- **It's more flexible**  
    It's not tied to your income or occupation. You can change jobs, start a business or study. You don't need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.
- **It's permanent**  
    You don't need to renew it every 2-3 years.[^12] It does not expire if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job). It only expires if you get deported or [travel outside of Germany](#travel-as-a-permanent-resident) for a long time.
- **It's more trusted**  
    It's easier to open a bank account, get a loan, get a mortgage, or find an apartment when you are a permanent resident.[^8]

You might also [qualify for German citizenship](#citizenship). It's better than permanent residence.

## Permanent residence requirements

### Basic requirements

To become a permanent resident, you must...

- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    Your income or your spouse's income must cover your cost of living. If you have children or an unemployed spouse, it must also cover their cost of living.[^40] Social benefits do not count as income.[^16]
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family. You need 10 to 13 m^2^ per person.[^51]
- [ ] **Have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)**  
    You need public or private health insurance. Public and private health insurance are accepted. [[Expat health insurance]] and travel insurance are not accepted.[^53]

There are more requirements, depending on your situation.


### If you have a [[Blue Card]]

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Have a job**  
    If you are unemployed, or if your contract ends in under 6 months, you probably won't get a [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis).[^36] Sometimes, they also reject people in their [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit).[^50]
- [ ] **Have a Blue Card for 21 to 27 months**  
    27 months if you speak [[A1]] German, or 21 months if you speak [[B1]] German.[^10] This includes the time when your job met the [Blue Card requirements](/guides/blue-card#blue-card-requirements), even if you had a different residence permit.[^41]
- [ ] **Speak [[A1]] or [[B1]] German**
- [ ] **Pay [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)**  
    You must pay 27 months of public pension insurance, or 21 months if you speak [[B1]] German. When you are employed, you do this automatically. See the [pension requirements](#pension-requirements).

### If you have a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Have a §18a, §18b or §18d work visa**[^38]  
    The type of work visa is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png). If you have a different type of residence permit, follow the [requirements for everybody else](#everybody-else).
- [ ] **Work for 2 to 3 years**[^11]  
    2 years if you graduated from a German university, or 3 years otherwise. This includes the time when your job met the [work visa requirements](/guides/work-visa#work-visa-requirements), even if you had a different residence permit.[^41]
- [ ] **Speak [[B1]] German**[^14]
- [ ] **Pay [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)**  
    You must pay 3 years of pension insurance, or 2 years if you graduated from a German university.[^19] When you are employed, you do this automatically. See the [pension requirements](#pension-requirements).

### If you have a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa)

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Have a §21 Abs. 1 or 2a freelance visa**[^6]  
    The type of freelance visa is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png). If you have a *§21 Abs. 5* freelance visa, follow the [requirements for everybody else](#everybody-else).
- [ ] **Have a freelance visa for 3 years**  
    In Berlin, it's okay if you had different businesses during that time. Your current business must be successful and profitable.[^26]
- [ ] **Have a profitable business**  
    You can get the [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 3 years if the *Ausländerbehörde* thinks that your business is successful and sustainable. The type of freelance visa is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png).
- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    In Berlin, they only check your own income from self-employment. Income from investments, from social benefits or from your spouse does not count.[^22]

In Berlin, there should be no pension or language requirement.[^39]

### If you live with a German citizen

To become a permanent resident, you must also...[^27]

- [ ] **Have a German spouse, child or parent**
- [ ] **Live together for 3 years**  
    You must live together, in Germany, for 3 years without interruption.[^29] You can also [become a citizen](#citizenship) after 3 years.
- [ ] **Speak [[B1]] German**  
    You can understand what people say when they talk in a simple language about certain topics. You can do things like open a bank account without help.

There is no pension requirement.[^56]

### If your spouse has a [[Blue Card]] or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Live with your spouse for 3 to 5 years**  
    3 years if you work at least 20 hours per week, or 5 years otherwise.[^28]

Your spouse must...

- [ ] **Have a job**  
    If they are unemployed, or if their contract ends in under 6 months, you probably won't get a PR. They might also reject you if your spouse is in their [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit).
- [ ] **Have a [[Blue Card]] or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)**  
    It must be a Blue Card, or a §18a, §18b or §18d work visa. The type of work visa is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png).

### If you have a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa)

You can't become a permanent resident while on a student visa.[^21] Wait until you have a different [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) like a [[Blue Card]], a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).

Your time as a student counts toward your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), but it's divided by half. For example, if you studied for 4 years, it counts as 2 years for your PR.[^9]

### If you are a refugee or asylum seeker

To become a permanent resident, you must...[^23]

- [ ] **Live in Germany for 3 to 5 years**  
    3 years if you speak [[C1]] German, or 5 years otherwise. This includes the asylum process time.[^54]
- [ ] **Speak [[A2]] or [[C1]] German**

There is no pension requirement for refugees and asylum seekers.[^55]

### Everyone else

To become a permanent resident, you must...

- [ ] **Live in Germany for 5 years**  
    Your time as a student counts, but it's divided by 2. For example, if you studied for 4 years, it counts as 2 years toward your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis). After 5 years in Germany, you can also [become a German citizen](#citizenship).
- [ ] **Speak [[B1]] German**[^14]
- [ ] **Have a retirement pension**  
    You must have a public pension, or an equivalent private pension. See the [pension requirements](#pension-requirements).

### Pension requirements

To get a PR, you must have an adequate retirement pension.[^17] There are 3 ways to do this:

- **Pay into the public pension system**  
    If you are an employee, you automatically pay into the public pension system. If you worked for 12 months, you contributed for 12 months.
- or **use your spouse's pension**
    If you are married, it's enough if your spouse has an adequate pension.[^18]
- or **get a private pension**  
    It must guarantee an income of at least {{ FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur }}€ per month for at least 12 years after you retire.[^42]
- or **have real estate or other investments**

If you don't have a pension, you can still [become a German citizen](#citizenship). There is no pension requirement for citizenship.

If you are self-employed, you don't pay for a public pension. Instead, you can...

- **Make voluntary public pension payments**  
    You can make the minimum contribution ({{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_MIN_CONTRIBUTION|cur}}€ per month) until you have 60 months of pension contributions. To make voluntary contributions, [fill form V0060](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0060.html?groupName_str=formulare).[^25]
- or **join the [[Künstlersozialkasse]]**  
    If you are a freelance artist, publicist or teacher, the KSK can pay half of your pension. It's a cheaper way to get a pension.
- or **get a private pension**
- or **use your spouse's pension**

## Permanent residence alternatives

### Citizenship

**You might qualify for German citizenship**, even if you can't get permanent residence.

To become a German citizen, you must...[^43]

- [ ] Live in Germany for 5 years, or 3 years if you have a German spouse[^47]
- [ ] Speak [[B1]] German[^48]
- [ ] Support yourself and your family, without social benefits
- [ ] Take the citizenship test (*Einbürgerungstest*)
- [ ] Not be convicted for a crime

Citizenship is better than permanent residence because...

- You get a German passport
- You can live and work in other [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) countries
- You can't lose your citizenship
- Your citizenship does not expire if you leave Germany
- You don't need a pension to qualify[^46]

If your country does not allow dual citizenship, becoming a German citizen means losing your old citizenship. Permanent residence might be a better option.

## How to apply in Berlin

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

### 1. Prepare your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) application

Before you apply for permanent residence, you must **prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**. If you are an employee, it's easy.

If you are self-employed, you need more documents. Some documents must be prepared by a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater). It can take a few weeks to prepare all your documents.

**[Find a tax advisor ➞](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin)**

### 2. Apply for [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)

You can't get an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment for this. You must [use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you.

### 3. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. They might contact you multiple times to ask for more documents.[^2] When they have all the documents they need, they will invite you for an appointment.

Sometimes, it takes so long that you must bring a more recent version of your documents.[^32]

**In Berlin, it usually takes 4 to 10 months.**[^5] It took me 9 months. If you wait more than 3 months after you apply, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde), but it might not help.

After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it usually takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your permanent residence.[^34]

Your current [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. You can continue working, studying or freelancing like before. If you get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, you can [travel with your expired residence permit](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-with-a-fiktionsbescheinigung).

It's okay to change jobs after you send your application.[^20]

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 4. Go to your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...

- [ ] **The [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    Bring all your application documents, even if you already sent them online. In your appointment invitation, the *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more documents.[^2]
- [ ] **Updated documents**  
    If you wait a really long time for an appointment, they might ask for more recent documents.[^32] For example, they might ask for updated proofs of employment and proofs of income.
- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You must print it.
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old. - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the application fee. It costs 109€ to 147€.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your permanent residence card. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **Your family**  
    If you apply as the spouse, parent or child of a German citizen, they must come with you to the appointment.[^30]
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    You can bring a translator or a German-speaking friend. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

The appointment takes 15 to 60 minutes.[^4] You spend most of that time in the waiting room.

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* employee will ask you questions in German. They will ask about your height, your eye colour, and the size of your apartment.[^1]

If they approve your permanent residence, they must print the plastic card. This takes a few weeks. You might get a temporary certificate while you wait.[^31] It allows you to stay in Germany, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to re-enter Germany.

**[What happens after your appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#after-your-appointment)**

### 5. Get your permanent residence card

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you get 2 letters:

1. **The [[eID]] activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your permanent residence card.
2. **Your permanent residence card**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you get your permanent residence card, or an invitation to collect it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^24] If you did not pay the fee, you must pay it during your *Ausländerbehörde* visit.[^33] The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

Check if the information on your permanent residence card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**. If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* where you apply.

**When you apply online**, use PDF files or photos. Word documents and other formats are unreliable. If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). You can also [mail your documents](/guide/mail-a-letter).

**When you go in person**, bring everything. Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees look at every document. Some ignore half of them. You never know, so you must bring everything. Missing documents can delay your application by a few weeks. Print everything on A4 paper. Do not staple the pages together.

### Required documents for everyone

- [ ] **Passport**  
    When you [apply online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait), include a colour scan of your passport. When you go in person, bring your passport. You get it back during the appointment; they do not keep it.
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Travel insurance is not accepted.
    - [ ] **Health insurance card**
    - [ ] or **proof of public health insurance**  
        Get a *[Mitgliedsbescheinigung nach 175 SGB V](/images/krankenkasse-mitgliedsbescheinigung-nach-175-sgb-v.png)* from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.
    - [ ] or **proof of private health insurance**  
        Bring your insurance contract, a *Mitgliedsbescheinigung*, and bank statements that show health insurance payments. Get these documents from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.[^6]
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance payments**  
    Bring recent bank account statements that show health insurance payments.
- [ ] **Proof of housing**  
    You need a [place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). If you apply in Berlin, your home address must be in Berlin.
    - [ ] **Lease**  
        It must show the size of your apartment. Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address). You must make enough money to pay your rent. It can be a temporary lease, a WG, a sublet or a student residence.
    - [ ] and **tenancy confirmation** (*[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*)  
        Some temporary apartments and sublets don't give you this document. You might not get a [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) without it. Bring it even if you registered your address.
    - [ ] and **registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)
    - [ ] and **proof of rent payments**  
        Print recent bank statements that show rent payments.[^52]
- [ ] **Proof of pension**  
    - **Versicherungsverlauf** from the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]  
        [Request a *Versicherungsverlauf*](/out/drv-pension-payments-info) online. It arrives by post in 1 to 3 weeks. If you have a working [[eID]], you can [get a *Versicherungsverlauf* instantly](https://kundenportal.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/od-kundenportal).[^35]
- [ ] **Translations**  
    If your documents are not in German, bring translations. For certificates and official documents, bring [certified translations](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung). They *sometimes* accept untranslated documents, but don't take the risk. Get translations from [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [Lingoking](/out/lingoking).

In Berlin, these documents are optional, but they can help:

- [ ] **Language certificate** or **integration course certificate**  
    This proves that you speak German. [Book a language test](https://www.testdaf.de/de/teilnehmende/mein-testdaf/testdaf-termine-und-anmeldung/) to get one. In Berlin, you don't need it. If you can answer questions in German during your *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, your German is good enough.[^3]

If you receive social benefits like *[[Kindergeld]]*, *Kinderzuschlag*, *Elterngeld*, *Betreuungsgeld* and other social benefits, you must bring...

- [ ] **Proof of social benefits**  
    Bring certificates and other documents that prove that you receive those social benefits.

### Optional documents

### Travel as a permanent resident

Your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) lets you visit other [[Schengen area]] countries without a visa.

**[Other places to ask immigration questions ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#immigration-questions)**
