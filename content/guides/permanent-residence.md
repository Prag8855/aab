If you lived in Germany for a few years, you can become a permanent resident.

As a permanent resident, you can...

- Live in Germany
- Work, study and freelance
- Bring your family to Germany
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa

This guide explains how to apply for permanent residence (PR) in Berlin. The rules can be different in other cities.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Why you should get permanent residence

Permanent residence means **more stability**. It's better than a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) because...

- **You can do what you want**  
    It's not tied to your income or occupation. It does not expire if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job). You can change jobs, start a business or study, without permission from the *Ausländerbehörde*.
- **You don't need to deal with the [[Ausländerbehörde]]**  
    After you get your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you don't need their permission to change jobs or do something else. You don't need to renew your permanent residence every 1-3 years.[^25]

There are other benefits: it's easier to find an apartment or get a mortgage, and you can get [[BAFöG]] if you study.[^8]

There is one small disadvantage: if you travel outside of Germany for more than 6 months, your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) expires. Other [residence permits](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) also expire after 6 months, but the [[Blue Card]] only expires after 12 months.[^20] For this, the Blue Card is a little better.

## Permanent residence requirements

There are **many ways to qualify** for permanent residence. The requirements are different for everyone.

### If you have a [[Blue Card]]

You must...

- [ ] **Have a Blue Card for 21 to 27 months**  
    27 months if you speak A1 German, or 21 months if you speak B1 German.[^10] This includes the time with a [[National Visa]] before you converted it to a Blue Card.[^22]
- [ ] **Speak A1 or B1 German**  
    If you speak B1 German, you can get your PR faster.
    - **A1** means that you know basic words and expressions, and very simple sentences for specific situations.
    - **B1** means that you can understand what people say when they talk in a simple language about certain topics. You can do things like open a bank account without help.
- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    Your income covers your cost of living. If you have children or an unemployed spouse, it also covers their cost of living.
- [ ] **Pay [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)**  
    You must pay 27 months of pension insurance, or 21 months if you speak B1 German. When you are employed, you automatically pay pension insurance.
- [ ] **Have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)**
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family.

### If you have a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)

You must...

- [ ] **Have a work visa for 2 to 3 years**  
    2 years if you graduated from a German university, or 3 years otherwise.[^11]
- [ ] **Speak B1 German**[^14]  
    You can understand what people say when they talk in a simple language about certain topics. You can do things like open a bank account without help.
- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    Your income covers your cost of living. If you have children or an unemployed spouse, it also covers their cost of living.
- [ ] **Pay [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)**  
    You must pay 3 years of pension insurance, or 2 years if you graduated from a German university.[^19] When you are employed, you automatically pay pension insurance.
- [ ] **Have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)**
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family.

### If you have a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa)

You can get a [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 3 to 5 years. It depends on the kind of freelance visa you have.[^6]

[Look on your residence permit.](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png) If it's written "§21 Abs. 1" or "§21 Abs. 2a" you must...

- [ ] **Have a freelance visa for 3 years**
- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    Your freelance income covers your cost of living. If you have children or an unemployed spouse, it also covers their cost of living.
- [ ] **Have valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)**
    Public and private health insurance are accepted. [[Expat health insurance]] or travel insurance is not enough.
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family.
- [ ] **Have a retirement pension**  
    There are many ways to do this:
    - **Have a public pension**  
        Do you only need 36 months of pension contributions? Not sure.
    - or have a private pension
    - or have investments

If it's written "§21 Abs. 5", you must wait 5 years like everybody else. See the [requirements for everybody else](#everybody-else).

### If you live with a German citizen

If you live with a spouse, parent or child who is a German citizen, you can get permanent residence in 3 years.

You must...[^27]

- [ ] **Have lived together for 3 years**  
    You must live together, in Germany, for 3 years without interruption.[^29]
- [ ] **Speak B1 German**  
    You can understand what people say when they talk in a simple language about certain topics. You can do things like open a bank account without help.
- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    Your income or your spouse's income covers your cost of living. If you have children or an unemployed spouse, it also covers their cost of living.[^16]
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family.

Spouses might need an integration course.[^37]

### If your spouse has a Blue Card or a work visa

You must...

- [ ] **Live with your spouse for 3 to 5 years**[^28]  
    5 years living with your spouse, or 3 years if you also work at least 20 hours per week.
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family.

Spouses might need an integration course.[^37]

### If you have a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa)

You can't apply for permanent residence.[^21] You can apply later when you get a different [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) like a Blue Card, a work visa or a freelance visa.

Your time as a student counts toward your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), but it's divided by half. For example, if you studied for 4 years, it counts as 2 years for your PR.[^9]

### If you are a refugee

- [ ] **Live in Germany for 5 years**  
    You must have a residence permit for the last 5 years, or 3 years if you speak C1 German.
- [ ] **Speak A2 or C1 German**[^23]  
    If you speak C1 German, you can get your PR faster.
    - **A2** means that you understand a few sentences and expressions about family, shopping, work and giving directions. You can have simple, direct conversations about certain topics.
    - **C1** means that you can express yourself easily. You don't need to think about what you will say. You can write texts about complex topics.
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family.
    
Spouse's income can suffice?

### Everyone else

There are more exceptions for...

- Minors
- Minors who became adults after entering Germany (§ 35 Abs. 1 S. 2 AufenthG)
- Retirees
- Former German citizens (§ 38 Abs. 1 S. 1
AufenthG)

These exceptions are not covered in this guide. If they apply to you, get help from a professional.

If other options don't apply to you, you must...

- [ ] **Live in Germany for 5 years**  
    Your time as a student counts, but it's divided by 2. For example, if you studied for 4 years, it counts as 2 years toward your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis).
- [ ] **Speak B1 German**[^14]  
    You can understand what people say when they talk in a simple language about certain topics.
- [ ] **Support yourself**
    Your income covers your cost of living. If you have children or an unemployed spouse, it also covers their cost of living.
- [ ] **Pay [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)**  
    You or your spouse must have paid 5 years of pension insurance.[^26]
- [ ] **Have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)**
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address) for you and your family.

**If you are currently unemployed**, you *might* get a [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) anyway, [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply for permanent residence. *[[Bürgergeld]]* does not count as a source of income.[^7]

**If your work contact ends in the next 6 months**, wait until you have a new contract before you apply.[^33]

## Permanent residence alternatives

**You might qualify for German citizenship**, even if you can't get permanent residence. Citizenship is better because you get a German passport, you can work in other EU countries, you can vote in elections. Citizenship can't be revoked, and it doesn't expire if you leave Germany for a long time.

### Pension

You must have an adequate retirement pension.[^17] There are 3 ways to do this:

- **Contribute to your public pension**  
    If you're an employee, you do this automatically, so if you worked for 60 months, you contributed for 60 months. If you're a student or self-employed, you usually don't contribute.
    - **If you are married**  
        If your spouse made 60 months of pension contributions, it's enough.[^18]
    - **Everyone else**  
        You must contribute to your public pension for 60 months.
- or **have a comparable private pension**  
    Usually, this means a private pension that *guarantees* an income when you retire.
- or **have investments**  
    This is where things get really unclear and complicated. It seems like having property qualifies you?

Just having money in your bank account is not enough. They don't care if you have a million euros, because it could be gone by the time your retire.

## How to apply in Berlin

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

### 1. Prepare your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) application

Before you apply for permanent residence, you must **prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**. If you are an employee, it's easy.

If you are self-employed, you need more documents. Some documents must be prepared by a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater). It can take a few weeks to prepare all your documents.

**[Find a tax advisor ➞](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin)**

### 2. Apply for [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)

You can't get an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment for this. You must [use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you.

### 3. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. They might contact you multiple times to ask for more documents.[^2] When they have all the documents they need, they will invite you for an appointment.

Sometimes, it takes so long that you must send a more recent version of the same documents.

**In Berlin, it usually takes 5 to 10 months.**[^5] It took me 9 months. If you wait more than 3 months after you apply, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde).

After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it usually takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your permanent residence.[^34]

Your current [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. You can continue working, studying or freelancing like before. If you get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, you can [travel with your expired residence permit](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-with-a-fiktionsbescheinigung).

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 4. Go to your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **The [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    Bring all your application documents, even if you already sent them online.[^47] In your appointment invitation, the *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more documents.[^2]
- [ ] **Updated documents**  
    The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more recent versions of your documents. For example, they might ask for updated proofs of employment and proofs of income.
- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You must print it.
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin).
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€ application fee.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your freelance visa. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend.[^63] It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

If you apply as the spouse, parent or child of a German citizen, they must come with you to the appointment.[^30]

In the email, they might ask for more documents. Sometimes, the process takes so long that they ask for an updated version of your documents.

The appointment takes 15 to 60 minutes.[^4] You spend most of that time waiting.

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* employee will ask you questions in German. It's just a simple conversation to see if you can speak German.[^1]

If they approve your permanent residence, they must print the plastic card. This takes a few weeks. You might get a temporary certificate while you wait.[^31] It allows you to stay in Germany, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to re-enter Germany.

**[What happens at the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

**[What happens after your appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#after-your-appointment)**

### 5. Get your permanent residence card

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment,[^22] you get 2 letters:

1. **The [[eID]] activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your permanent residence card.
2. **Your permanent residence card**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your permanent residence card, or an invitation to collect it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^24] If you did not pay the fee, you must pay it during your *Ausländerbehörde* visit. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

Check if the information on your permanent residence card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**. If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* where you apply.

**When you apply online**, use PDF files or photos. Word documents and other formats are unreliable. If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). You can also [mail your documents](/guide/mail-a-letter).

**When you go in person**, bring everything. Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees look at every document. Some ignore half of them. You never know, so you must bring everything. Missing documents can delay your application by a few weeks. Print everything on A4 paper. Do not staple the pages together.

### Required documents for everyone

- [ ] **Passport**  
    When you [apply online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait), include a colour scan of your passport. When you go in person, bring your passport. You get it back during the appointment; they do not keep it.
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Travel insurance is not accepted.
    - [ ] **Health insurance card**
    - [ ] or **proof of public health insurance**  
        Get a *[Mitgliedsbescheinigung nach 175 SGB V](/images/krankenkasse-mitgliedsbescheinigung-nach-175-sgb-v.png)* from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.
    - [ ] or **proof of private health insurance**  
        Bring your insurance contract, a *Mitgliedsbescheinigung*, and bank statements that show health insurance payments. Get these documents from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.[^6]
- [ ] **Proof of housing**  
    You need a [place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). If you apply in Berlin, your home address must be in Berlin.
    - [ ] **Lease**  
        It must show the size of your apartment. Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address). You must make enough money to pay your rent. It can be a temporary lease, a WG, a sublet or a student residence.[^41]
    - [ ] and **tenancy confirmation** (*[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*)  
        Some temporary apartments and sublets don't give you this document. You might not get a [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) without it.[^1] Bring it even if you registered your address.[^43]
    - [ ] and **registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)
    - [ ] and **proof of rent payments** (optional)
        Print recent bank statements that show rent payments.[^52]
- [ ] **Proof of pension**  
    - **Versicherungsverlauf** from the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]
        You can [request a *Versicherungsverlauf*](/out/drv-pension-payments-info) online. It will arrive by post in 1 to 3 weeks.[^36] If you have a working [[eID]], you can [get a *Versicherungsverlauf* instantly](https://kundenportal.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/od-kundenportal).[^35]
- [ ] **Language certificate** or **integration course certificate** (optional in Berlin)  
    This proves that you speak German. [Book a language test](https://www.testdaf.de/de/teilnehmende/mein-testdaf/testdaf-termine-und-anmeldung/) to get one. In Berlin, you don't need it. If you can answer questions in German during your *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, your German is good enough.[^3]
- [ ] **Translations**  
    If your documents are not in German, bring translations. For certificates and official documents, bring [certified translations](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung). They *sometimes* accept untranslated documents, but don't take the risk.[^32] Get translations from [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [Lingoking](/out/lingoking).

If you receive social benefits like *[[Kindergeld]]*, *Kinderzuschlag*, *Elterngeld*, *Betreuungsgeld* and other social benefits, you must bring...

- [ ] **Proof of social benefits**  
    Bring certificates and other documents that prove that you receive those social benefits.

### For people with a Blue Card

**[Full requirements for Blue Card holders ➞](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/326556/en/)**

### For people with a freelance visa

If you need a permit to do your job (lawyers, doctors, engineers), you must also bring...

- [ ] **Occupation practice permit** (*Berufsausübungserlaubnis*)  
    You must have all the permits and special qualifications needed for the job. For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need special qualifications. - [Find the requirements for your job](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)

If you can, you should also bring...

- [ ] **Trade certificate** (*[[Gewerbeschein]]*)  
    [Register for trade tax](/guides/gewerbeschein) and get your *Gewerbeschein*. This might be impossible, because it requires a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). You can do it later.[^70] You can do it later, before you [renew your residence permit](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa).
- [ ] **[Trade register](/glossary/Handelsregister) entry** (*Handelsregisterauszug*)  
    You probably don't need a *Handelsregister* entry.[^77] If you need one, you can probably get it after you get your freelance visa. - [Who needs a *Handelsregister* entry?](/guides/handelsregisternummer-germany#who-needs-a-handelsregister-entry)

**[Full requirements for self-employed people ➞](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/326564/en/)**

### Required documents if you apply in person

- [ ] **Appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment.
- [ ] **[Application form](/docs/residence-permit-application-form)** (*Antrag auf Erteilung eines Aufenthaltstitels*)

- [ ] **Passport**  
    You get your passport back during your appointment; they do not keep it.[^75]
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    Only if apply in person. You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin).
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the 113€ to 147€ application fee.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your work visa. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

### Optional documents

These documents are not required, but some *Ausländerbehörde* employees ask for them. They make your application more convincing.

- [ ] **Resume** or **CV**  
    It proves that you have experience in your field. Remove irrelevant experience or summer jobs. Work experience is not required, but it helps.[^49]
- [ ] **Cover letter**  
    It explains what you do, and how your business works. It helps *Ausländerbehörde* employees understand your plan. This is very useful if your German is not good. Write it in German. - [Cover letter example](/docs/freelance-visa-cover-letter)
- [ ] **Portfolio** or **examples of your work**  
    It explains what you do. If you are an artist, this is very important.[^65] For example, you can bring photos of your work, posters of your events, screenshots of your website or apps or newspaper articles about you. You need printed examples; a website address does not work.[^50] If you can, fit everything on A4 paper.
- [ ] **Contracts**  
    It proves that you have guaranteed work. Signed contracts are better than [letters of intent](/glossary/Absichtserklärung). They should explain what you will do, how long you will work and how much you will get paid.
- [ ] **Letters of reference**  
    These are letters from your previous employers, clients or professors that recommend you for your work. If you are a scientist or researcher, this is very important.[^46] The letters must be related to the work you do.
- [ ] **Proof or education**  
    If your education is relevant to your business, prove it. Bring the original diplomas if you can. Copies also work.[^38] If you have no relevant education, it's okay.[^78]
- [ ] **Bank statements**  
    It shows how much savings you have.[^74] 3,000€ to 5,000€ in savings is enough. If possible, use a German bank.[^61] If it's in another currency, convert it to euros.

## After you get your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)

### Activate your [[eID]]

You can use your permanent residence card to log into online government services. You must activate this feature at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Activate your eID before you need it.**

**[How to activate your eID ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### If you travel as a permanent resident

Your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) lets you visit other [[Schengen area]] countries without a visa.

With a PR, you can leave Germany for up to 6 months.[^23] To travel longer, you need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

### Make a tax declaration

Your immigration expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep all your receipts. Include them in your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). You will pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).

## Need help?

An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions.

**[Other places to ask immigration questions ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#immigration-questions)**

The *Ausländerbehörde* can answer your questions, but they are very hard to contact. They can take months to answer. Sometimes they don't answer at all.
