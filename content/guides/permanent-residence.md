If you live in Germany for a few years, you can become a permanent resident.

As a permanent resident, you can...

- Live in Germany
- Work, study and freelance
- Bring your family to Germany
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa

This guide explains how to apply for permanent residence in Berlin. The rules can be different in other cities.

## Why you should get permanent residence

Permanent residence means **more stability**. It's better than a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) because...

- **You can do what you want**  
    It's not tied to your income or occupation. It does not expire if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job). You can change jobs, start a business or study. You don't need permission from the *Ausländerbehörde*.
- **You are done with the [[Ausländerbehörde]]**  
    You don't need to renew it every 1-3 years. You don't need permission from the *Ausländerbehörde* to change jobs or do something else.

There are other smaller benefits:

- **It's easier to [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    Landlords prefer stable tenants who will live there for a long time. Permanent residence shows that you won't leave Germany soon.[^9]
- **It's easier to get a mortgage**  
    You usually need to be a citizen or a permanent resident to get a mortgage. You get a lower interest rate than with a residence permit.
- **You can get [[BAFöG]]**  
    Permanent residents can get financial aid to study in Germany.[^8]

## Permanent residence requirements

{% include "_blocks/permanentResidenceCheck.html" %}

To become a permanent resident, you must...

- [ ] **Live in Germany for a few years**  
    You must live in Germany for at least 60 months, but there are exceptions. It depends on which [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) you have:
    - **[[Blue Card]]**  
        You can get permanent residence in 27 months if you speak A1 German, or 21 months if you speak B1 German.[^10]
    - **[Work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)** - §18a, §18b, §18d or §18g  
        You can get permanent residence after 3 years. If you graduated from a German university, you can get it after 2 years.[^11]
    - **[[Freelance visa]]** - §21 Abs. 1 or §21 Abs. 2a  
        You can get permanent residence after 3 years. If you have a *§21 Abs. 5* freelance visa, you must wait 5 years.[^6]
    - **Spouse of a German citizen**  
        You can get permanent residence after living 3 years together in Germany.[^12]
- [ ] **Speak German**  
    You must speak at least B1 German. If you have a Blue Card, you only need A1 German.[^10]
- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    Your income must cover your cost of living. If you are currently unemployed, find a job before you apply for permanent residence. *[[Bürgergeld]]* does not count as a source of income.[^7]
- [ ] **Speak German**  
    You must speak B1 German. If you have a [[Blue Card]], you can get permanent residence with A1 German after 27 months.
- [ ] **Have savings for retirement**  
    ...

**You might qualify for German citizenship**, even if you can't get permanent residence. Citizenship is better because you get a German passport, you can work in other EU countries, you can vote in elections. Citizenship can't be revoked, and it doesn't expire if you leave Germany for a long time.

## How to apply in Berlin

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

### 1. Prepare your permanent residence application

Before you apply for permanent residence, you must **prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**. If you are an employee, it's easy.

If you are self-employed, you need more documents. Some documents must be prepared by a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater). It can take a few weeks to prepare all your documents.

**[Find a tax advisor ➞](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin)**

### 2. Apply for permanent residence

You can't get an Ausländerbehörde appointment for permanent. You must [use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you.

**[How to get an Ausländerbehörde appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**

### 3. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. They might contact you multiple times to ask for more documents.[^2] When they have all the documents they need, they will invite you for an appointment. This can take many months.

Sometimes, it takes so long that you must send an updated version of the same documents.

In Berlin, it usually takes 5 to 10 months.[^5] It took me 9 months. If you wait more than 3 months after you apply, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde).

After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it usually takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your permanent residence.

Your current [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. You can continue working, studying or freelancing like before. If you get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, you can [travel with your expired residence permit](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-with-a-fiktionsbescheinigung).

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 4. Go to your permanent residence appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **The [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    Bring all your application documents, even if you already sent them online.[^47] In your appointment invitation, the *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more documents.[^2]
- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You must print it.
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin).
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€ application fee.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your freelance visa. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend.[^63] It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

In the email, they might ask for more documents. Sometimes, the process takes so long that they ask for an updated version of your documents.

The appointment takes 15 to 60 minutes.[^4] You spend most of that time waiting.

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* employee will ask you questions in German. It's just a simple conversation to see if you can speak German.[^1]

If they approve your freelance visa, they must print the plastic card. This takes a few weeks. You might get a [temporary certificate](/images/temporary-freelance-visa.jpg) while you wait. It allows you to start working, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to re-enter Germany.

**[What happens at the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

**[What happens after your appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#after-your-appointment)**

### 5. Get your permanent residence card

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment,[^22] you get 2 letters:

1. **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your freelance visa.
2. **Your freelance visa**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your freelance visa, or an invitation to collect it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^28] If you did not pay the {{ NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur }}€ fee, you must pay it during your *Ausländerbehörde* visit. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

Your freelance visa is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on it. It's **valid for up to 3 years**.[^17] If they are not sure that your business will work, you might get a shorter freelance visa.[^24]

You also get a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. It describes the conditions of your freelance visa. If you lived in Germany for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It allows you to be self-employed, and have a side job. - [More information](https://redtapetranslation.com/why-erwerbstatigkeit-gestattet-doesnt-always-mean-you-can-do-whatever-you-want/)

Check if the information on your freelance visa is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**. If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* where you apply.

**If you [apply online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait)**, use PDF files or photos. Word documents and other formats are unreliable.[^37] If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). You can also mail your documents.

**If you [apply in person](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#)**, bring everything. Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees look at every document. Some ignore half of them. You never know, so you must bring everything. Missing documents can delay your application by a few weeks. Print everything on A4 paper. Do not staple the pages together.

### Required documents for everyone

- [ ] **Passport**  
    If you [apply online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait), include a colour scan of your passport. If you go in person, bring your passport. You get it back during the appointment; they do not keep it.[^75]
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Travel insurance is not accepted. [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose health insurance.
    - [ ] **Health insurance card**
    - [ ] or **proof of public health insurance**  
        Get a *[Mitgliedsbescheinigung nach 175 SGB V](/images/krankenkasse-mitgliedsbescheinigung-nach-175-sgb-v.png)* from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.
    - [ ] or **proof of private health insurance**  
        Bring your insurance contract, a *Mitgliedsbescheinigung*, and bank statements that show health insurance payments. Get these documents from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.[^6]
- [ ] **Proof of housing**  
    You need a [place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). If you apply in Berlin, your home address must be in Berlin.
    - [ ] **Lease**  
        It must show the size of your apartment. Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address). You must make enough money to pay your rent. It can be a temporary lease, a sublet or a student residence.[^41]
    - [ ] and **tenancy confirmation** (*[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*)  
        Some temporary apartments and sublets don't give you this document. You might not get a work visa without it.[^1] Bring it even if you registered your address.[^43]
    - [ ] and **registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)  
        You must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) to get this document. If you don't have it, your lease and [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) are sometimes enough. At least bring proof that you have a [*Bürgeramt* appointment](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#get-a-burgeramt-appointment).[^5]
    - [ ] and **proof of rent payments**  
        You must show what you really pay for housing. Print recent bank statements that show rent payments.[^52]
- [ ] **Language certificate** (optional)  
    You must prove that you speak German. If you don't have a language certificate, they will ask you questions in German during your *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, to see if you speak German.[^3]
- [ ] **Translations**  
    If your documents are not in German, bring translations. For certificates and official documents, bring [certified translations](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung). They *sometimes* accept untranslated documents, but don't take the risk.[^32] Get translations from [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [Lingoking](/out/lingoking).

If you are over 45 years old, and you are not a citizen of {{AUFENTHG_21_2_COUNTRIES}}, you must have...[^58]

These documents are not required, but some *Ausländerbehörde* employees ask for them. They make your application more convincing.

- [ ] **Cover letter**

- [ ] **Portfolio** or **examples of your work**  
    It explains what you do. If you are an artist, this is very important.[^65] For example, you can bring photos of your work, posters of your events, screenshots of your website or apps or newspaper articles about you. You need printed examples; a website address does not work.[^50] If you can, fit everything on A4 paper.
- [ ] **Contracts**

## After you get your permanent residence

### Activate your eID

You can use your freelance visa to log into online government services. For example, you need it for the *[[Gewerbeanmeldung]]*. You must activate this feature at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Activate your eID before you need it.**

Your permanent residence does not expire. You don't need to go to the immigration office.

Your permanent residence *card* can expire. To renew it...

### If you travel as a permanent resident

Your freelance visa lets you visit other [[Schengen area]] countries without a visa.

With a freelance visa, you can leave Germany for up to 6 months.[^23] To travel longer, you need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

### Make a tax declaration

Your immigration expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep all your receipts. Include them in your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). You will pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).
