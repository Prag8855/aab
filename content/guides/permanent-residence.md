If you lived in Germany for a few years, you can become a permanent resident.

Permanent residents can...

- Live in Germany
- Work, study and freelance without the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*'s permission
- Bring your family to Germany
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa

## Why become a permanent resident

Permanent residence means **more stability**. It's better than a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) because...

- **It's more flexible**  
    It's not tied to your income or occupation. You can change jobs, start a business or study. You don't need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.
- **It's permanent**  
    You don't need to renew it every 2 or 3 years.[^12] It does not expire if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job). It only expires if you [travel outside of Germany](#travel-as-a-permanent-resident) for a long time.
- **It's more trusted**  
    It's easier to [open a bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany), get a loan, get a mortgage, or [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) as a permanent resident.[^8]

You might also [qualify for German citizenship](#citizenship). Citizenship is better than permanent residence.

## Permanent residence requirements

### Basic requirements

To become a permanent resident, you must...

- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    Your income or your spouse's income must cover your cost of living.[^60] It must also cover your children and unemployed spouse's cost of living.[^40] Income from social benefits like *[[Bürgergeld]]* and *Sozialhilfe* do not count. Income from *[[Kindergeld]]*, *Elterngeld*, *Kinderzuschlag* and *Erziehungsgeld* counts.[^16]
- [ ] **Have a place to live**  
    Your apartment must be big enough for you and your family. You need 9 m^2^ per adult, and 6 m^2^ per child.[^51]
- [ ] **Have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)**  
    You need public or private health insurance. [[Expat health insurance]] and travel insurance are not accepted.

There are more requirements, depending on your situation.

### If you have a [[Blue Card]]

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Have a job**  
    You must have a stable, long-term income. If you are unemployed, if you are in your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit), or if your work contract ends in the next 6 months, you might not get a [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis). If you have a history of stable employment, you might get it anyway.[^36]
- [ ] **Have a Blue Card for 21 to 27 months**  
    27 months if you speak [[A1]] German, or 21 months if you speak [[B1]] German.[^10] This includes the time when you met the [Blue Card requirements](/guides/blue-card#blue-card-requirements), but had a different [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^41]
- [ ] **Speak [[A1]] or [[B1]] German**
- [ ] **Pay [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)**  
    You must pay 27 months of public pension insurance, or 21 months if you speak [[B1]] German. When you are employed, you do this automatically. See the [pension requirements](#pension-requirements).

### If you have a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Have a §18a, §18b or §18d work visa**[^38]  
    The type of work visa is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png). If you have a different type of residence permit, follow the [requirements for everybody else](#everybody-else).
- [ ] **Work for 2 to 3 years**[^11]  
    2 years if you graduated from a German university, or 3 years otherwise. This includes the time when you met the [work visa requirements](/guides/work-visa#work-visa-requirements), but had a different [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^41]
- [ ] **Speak [[B1]] German**[^14]
- [ ] **Pay [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)**  
    You must pay 3 years of pension insurance, or 2 years if you graduated from a German university.[^19] When you are employed, you do this automatically. See the [pension requirements](#pension-requirements).

### If you have a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa)

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Have a §21 Abs. 1 or 2a freelance visa for 3 years**[^6]  
    The type of freelance visa is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png). If you have a *§21 Abs. 5* freelance visa, follow the [requirements for everybody else](#everybody-else).
- [ ] **Have a profitable business**  
    You can get the [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 3 years if the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* thinks that your business is successful, profitable and sustainable.
- [ ] **Support yourself**  
    In Berlin, they only check your own income from self-employment. Income from investments does not count. Income from your spouse does not count.[^22]

In Berlin, there should be no pension or language requirement.[^39]

If you don't meet those requirements, follow the [requirements for everybody else](#everybody-else).

### If you live with a German citizen

To become a permanent resident, you must also...[^27]

- [ ] **Have a German spouse, child or parent**
- [ ] **Live together for 3 years**  
    You must live together, in Germany, for 3 years without interruption.[^29]
- [ ] **Speak [[B1]] German**  
    You can understand what people say when they talk in a simple language about certain topics. You can do things like open a bank account without help.

There is no pension requirement.[^56]

You can also [become a citizen](#citizenship) after 3 years.

### If your spouse has a [[Blue Card]] or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)

To become a permanent resident, you must also...

- [ ] **Live with your spouse for 3 to 5 years**  
    3 years if you work at least 20 hours per week, or 5 years otherwise.[^28] It should not be a new job or a temporary job.[^63] Self-employment is allowed.[^62]

Your spouse must...

- [ ] **Have a job**  
    If they are unemployed, or if their contract ends in under 6 months, you probably won't get a PR. They might also reject you if your spouse is in their [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit).
- [ ] **Have a [[Blue Card]] or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)**  
    It must be a Blue Card, or a §18a, §18b or §18d work visa. The type of work visa is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png).

### If you have a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa)

You can't become a permanent resident while on a student visa.[^21] Wait until you have a different [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) like a [[Blue Card]], a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa).

Your time as a student counts toward your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), but it's divided by half. For example, if you studied for 4 years, it counts as 2 years for your PR.[^9]

### If you are a refugee or asylum seeker

To become a permanent resident, you must...[^23]

- [ ] **Have the correct residence permit**  
    You must have a *§25 Abs. 1*, *§25 Abs. 2 S. 1*, or *§23 Abs. 4* residence permit.[^26] The type is [written on your residence permit](/illustrations/freelance-visa-type.png).
- [ ] **Live in Germany for 3 to 5 years**  
    3 years if you speak [[C1]] German, or 5 years otherwise. This includes the asylum process time.[^54]
- [ ] **Speak [[A2]] or [[C1]] German**

There is no pension requirement for refugees and asylum seekers.[^55]

### Everyone else

To become a permanent resident, you must...

- [ ] **Live in Germany for 5 years**  
    Your time as a student counts, but it's divided by 2. For example, if you studied for 4 years, it counts as 2 years toward your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis). After 5 years in Germany, you can also [become a German citizen](#citizenship).
- [ ] **Speak [[B1]] German**[^20]
- [ ] **Have a retirement pension**  
    See the [pension requirements](#pension-requirements).

### Pension requirements

To get a PR, you need a retirement pension.[^17] There are 4 ways to do this:

- **Pay into the public pension system**  
    If you are an employee, you automatically pay into the public pension system. If you worked for 12 months, you contributed for 12 months.
- or **use your spouse's pension**  
    If you are married, it's enough if your spouse has an adequate pension.[^18]
- or **get a private pension**  
    It must *guarantee* an income of at least {{ FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur }}€ per month for at least 12 years after you retire. It must include a pension in case of disability.[^42]
- or **have real estate or other investments**  
    Stable income from your investments can replace a pension.[^32]

In Berlin, you need a *guaranteed* pension. Stocks or money in your bank account are not enough.[^61] Investments that bring a stable income might be enough. There is no clear information about this.

If you are self-employed, you don't pay for a public pension. Instead, you can...

- **Make voluntary public pension payments**  
    You can make the minimum contribution ({{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_MIN_CONTRIBUTION|cur}}€ per month) until you have 60 months of pension contributions. To make voluntary contributions, [fill form V0060](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0060.html?groupName_str=formulare).[^25] You can make retroactive payments for up to 1 year.
- or **join the [[Künstlersozialkasse]]**  
    If you are a freelance artist, publicist or teacher, the KSK can pay half of your pension. It's a cheaper way to get a pension.
- or **get a private pension**
- or **use your spouse's pension**

If you are a refugee or an asylum seeker, you don't need a pension.[^55]

If you don't have a pension, you can [become a German citizen](#citizenship) instead. There is no pension requirement for citizenship.

## Permanent residence alternatives

### Citizenship

**You might qualify for German citizenship**, even if you can't get permanent residence.

To become a German citizen, you must...[^43]

- [ ] Live in Germany for 5 years, or 3 years if you have a German spouse[^47]
- [ ] Speak [[B1]] German[^48]
- [ ] Support yourself and your family, without social benefits
- [ ] Take the citizenship test (*Einbürgerungstest*)
- [ ] Not be convicted for a crime

Citizenship is better than permanent residence because...

- You get a German passport
- You can live and work in other [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) countries
- You can't lose your citizenship
- Your citizenship does not expire if you leave Germany
- You don't need a pension to qualify[^46]

If your country does not allow dual citizenship, becoming a German citizen means losing your old citizenship. Permanent residence might be a better option.

## How to apply in Berlin

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

In Berlin, **it takes 4 to 10 months** to get permanent residence.[^5] It took me 10 months in total. If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde), but it might not help.

### 1. Prepare your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) application

Before you apply for permanent residence, prepare your documents.

If you are self-employed, some documents must be prepared by a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater). It can be hard to [find a tax advisor](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin). It can take a few weeks to prepare the documents.

**[Required documents ➞](#required-documents)**

### 2. Apply for [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)

You can't get an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment for this. You must [use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you. You might not get a confirmation email.

### 3. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. You might get no response for a few months. When I applied, they took 3 months to reply.

When they reply, they might ask for more documents.[^2] They might need more recent

If you can't reply to their email, use the [contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact) to send more documents.[^53]

When they have the documents they need, they will give you an appointment. In the appointment invitation, they might ask for more documents.

After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it usually takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your permanent residence.[^34]

Your current [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. You can continue working, studying or freelancing like before. If you get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, you can [travel with your expired residence permit](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-with-a-fiktionsbescheinigung).

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 4. Go to your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...

- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You must print it.
- [ ] **Extra required documents**  
    In your appointment invitation, the *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more documents.[^2] They might need for more recent proof of income, employment, health insurance and rent payments. Print them and bring them. Do not bring the documents that you already sent.[^69]
- [ ] **Passport**  
    You get your passport back during your appointment; they do not keep it.
    - [ ] **Passport of your spouse, parent or child**[^7] (if applicable)
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old. - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the application fee. It costs {{MIN_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE|cur}}€ to {{MAX_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE|cur}}€.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your permanent residence card. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **Your family**  
    If you apply as the spouse, parent or child of a German citizen, they must come with you to the appointment.[^30]
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    You can bring a translator or a German-speaking friend. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

The appointment takes around 15 minutes.[^4] They call your number on the screen, you meet your case worker, give your documents, and answer a few questions. They ask you questions in German about your height, your eye colour, and the size of your apartment.[^1]

If they approve your permanent residence, you must pay the {{MIN_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE|cur}}€ to {{MAX_PERMANENT_RESIDENCE_FEE|cur}}€ fee.[^44] They will give you a plastic payment card. Bring it to the payment machine and pay the fee. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt. After you paid, you can leave.

They must print your permanent residence card. This takes a few weeks. You will get a second appointment to pick up the card. They will not mail the card to you.[^67]

You might get a temporary certificate while you wait.[^31] It allows you to stay in Germany, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to re-enter Germany. If you have a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, they can extend it until your second appointment date.[^68]

**[What happens after your appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#after-your-appointment)**

### 5. Get your permanent residence card

A few weeks later, go to your second appointment, and collect your permanent residence card. Check if the information on your permanent residence card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

You will also get a letter with **the activation code for your [[eID]]**. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your permanent residence card.

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**. If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* where you apply.

### Travel as a permanent resident

Your [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) lets you visit other [[Schengen area]] countries without a visa.

### Make a tax declaration

### Renew your permanent residence

**When you get a new passport**, your permanent residence *card* becomes invalid. You are still a permanent resident, but you must get a new card.

To get a new card, [get a Bürgeramt appointment](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324280/en/), go in person, pay {{RESIDENCE_PERMIT_REPLACEMENT_FEE|cur}}€, and wait a few weeks.[^64] You should get the card by post. The [[eID]] function might be deactivated on your new card. You might need [another *Bürgeramt* appointment](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/329830/) to activate it.[^65]

## Need help?

An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions.

**[Other places to ask immigration questions ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#immigration-questions)**

The *Ausländerbehörde* can answer your questions, but they are very hard to contact. They can take months to answer. Sometimes they don't answer at all.
