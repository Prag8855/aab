The **permanent residence** allows you to live in Germany. It's better than a residence permit, but not as good as German citizenship.

As a permanent resident, you can...

- Live in Germany
- Bring your family to Germany
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa

This guide explains how to apply for permanent residence in Berlin. In other German cities, the application process can be different.

## How to apply in Berlin

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

### 1. Prepare your permanent residence application

Before you apply for the freelance visa, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address).
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. In Berlin, your income must be more than your rent + your health insurance + {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month before taxes.[^53]
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a freelance visa.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Many applications are rejected because of invalid health insurance.[^30] [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance. Their help is free. - [Health insurance options for a freelance visa](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    This takes a few weeks. Start as soon as you can.

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. You must prepare these documents too.

While you wait for an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for your registration certificate.[^76] - [Why the *Anmeldung* is important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address)
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#step-2-open-a-bank-account)**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your application fee, and get paid by your clients. You should open a separate bank account for your business. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

If you are self-employed, find a tax advisor.

### 2. Apply for permanent residence

There are 2 ways to apply for a freelance visa in Berlin:

- **Apply in person**  
    [Get an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment), go to your appointment, give your documents, and wait for your permanent residence. It's almost impossible to get an appointment.
- or **send your documents online**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    [Use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you. A few weeks later, they will give you an appointment. Usually, this is your only option.

**[How to get an Ausländerbehörde appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**

### 3. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. They might contact you multiple times to ask for more documents. When they have all the documents they need, they will invite you for an appointment.

Sometimes, it takes so long that they will ask for updated documents.

In Berlin, it takes up to 1 year in total.  If you wait more than 3 months after you apply, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde).

If you [send your documents online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait), it takes a few months to get invited for an appointment. After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your freelance visa.

In most cases, your current [[National Visa]] or a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. If your current residence permit does not allow self-employment, you must wait for your freelance visa to start your business.[^55]

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 4. Go to your permanent residence appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **The [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    Bring all your application documents, even if you already sent them online.[^47] In your appointment invitation, the *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more documents.
- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You must print it.
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin).
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€ application fee.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your freelance visa. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend.[^63] It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

The appointment takes 15 to 60 minutes.[^64] You spend most of that time waiting.

If they approve your freelance visa, they must print the plastic card. This takes a few weeks. You might get a [temporary certificate](/images/temporary-freelance-visa.jpg) while you wait. It allows you to start working, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to re-enter Germany.

**[What happens at the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

**[What happens after your appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#after-your-appointment)**

### 5. Get your permanent residence card

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment,[^22] you get 2 letters:

1. **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your freelance visa.
2. **Your freelance visa**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your freelance visa, or an invitation to collect it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^28] If you did not pay the {{ NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur }}€ fee, you must pay it during your *Ausländerbehörde* visit. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

Your freelance visa is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on it. It's **valid for up to 3 years**.[^17] If they are not sure that your business will work, you might get a shorter freelance visa.[^24]

You also get a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. It describes the conditions of your freelance visa. If you lived in Germany for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It allows you to be self-employed, and have a side job. - [More information](https://redtapetranslation.com/why-erwerbstatigkeit-gestattet-doesnt-always-mean-you-can-do-whatever-you-want/)

Check if the information on your freelance visa is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**. If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* where you apply.

**If you [apply online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait)**, use PDF files or photos. Word documents and other formats are unreliable.[^37] If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). You can also mail your documents.

**If you [apply in person](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#)**, bring everything. Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees look at every document. Some ignore half of them. You never know, so you must bring everything. Missing documents can delay your application by a few weeks. Print everything on A4 paper. Do not staple the pages together.

### Required documents for everyone

- [ ] **Passport**  
    If you [apply online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait), include a colour scan of your passport. If you go in person, bring your passport. You get it back during the appointment; they do not keep it.[^75]

        It must show the size of your apartment. Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-the-same-address). You must make enough money to pay your rent. It can be a temporary lease, a sublet or a student residence.[^41]
    - [ ] and **tenancy confirmation** (*[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*)  
        Some temporary apartments and sublets don't give you this document. You might not get a work visa without it.[^1] Bring it even if you registered your address.[^43]
    - [ ] and **registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)  
        You must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) to get this document. If you don't have it, your lease and [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) are sometimes enough.

        You must show what you really pay for housing. Print recent bank statements that show rent payments.[^52]
