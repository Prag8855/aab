This guide explains how to choose health insurance for a German visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## For a Schengen visa

To apply for a [[Schengen visa]] (tourist visa), you need **travel health insurance**.[^0]

Your travel health insurance must...[^1]

- [ ] Cover you for at least €30,000
- [ ] Be valid in *all* Schengen area countries, not just Germany
- [ ] Be valid during your whole trip in the [[Schengen area]]

**[HanseMerkur Visa Plus](/out/hansemerkur-travel)** works well for a Schengen visa application.

[If you can visit Germany without a visa](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/-/231148), you don't need travel insurance, but it's still a good idea.

## For a National Visa

To apply for a [[National Visa]] at the German embassy or consulate, you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). This temporary insurance covers you during your first few months in Germany.

When you arrive in Germany, you must usually switch to [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. You must switch before you convert your National Visa to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).

Use my [health insurance picker](/tools/health-insurance-calculator), or [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you.

The requirements depend on the visa you apply for:

- [Health insurance for a **Blue Card**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-blue-card-or-work-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **work visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-blue-card-or-work-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **student visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students#insurance-for-a-student-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **freelance visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers#insurance-for-a-freelance-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **Working Holiday Visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-working-holiday-visa)
- [Health insurance for a **Youth Mobility Visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-youth-mobility-visa)
- [Health insurance for an **opportunity card**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-an-opportunity-card)
- [Health insurance for a **job seeker visa**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees#for-a-job-seeker-visa)

## For a residence permit

After you arrive in Germany, you must convert your [[National Visa]] to a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. Some people can also enter Germany without a visa, and apply directly for a residence permit.

To apply for residence permit, you need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. [Expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) is sometimes accepted.

The requirements depend on your occupation:

- [Health insurance for an **employee**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-employees)
- [Health insurance for a **student**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-students)
- [Health insurance for a **freelancer**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-freelancers)
- [Health insurance for an **apprentice**](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-apprentices)

## How to choose

Don't choose health insurance yourself. You can make expensive mistakes. Choosing the wrong insurance can delay your visa application.

[Ask my health insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose. His help is free. It's the best way to choose health insurance.

### Expat health insurance options

These insurers usually work:

- **[Feather](/out/feather-expats)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    It works really well.[^12] They sell public, private and expat health from a few companies. They speak English. I work with them since 2018, and I trust them the most.
- **[Ottonova](/out/ottonova-expats)**  
    It works well too.[^4] They sell their own private and expat health insurance. They speak English. They are not the cheapest long-term option. - [My review of Ottonova](/guides/ottonova-review)
- **[Care Concept](/out/care-concept)**  
    It's usually accepted.[^5] It's not the best insurance, but it works.
- **[April International](https://de.april-international.com/de)**[^7]
- **[aLC](https://www.alchealth.com/)**[^6]
- **[Allianz Worldwide Care](https://www.allianzcare.com/en.html)**[^13]

These insurers are less reliable:

- **[Mawista Expatcare](/out/mawista-expats)** is not always accepted[^8]
- **[Cigna Global](/out/cigna)** is not always accepted[^9]
