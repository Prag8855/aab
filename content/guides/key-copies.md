## Who pays for the keys?

When you [move in](/guides/moving-in), you must get a set of keys for every adult who lives there. This includes a key for the building door, your apartment door and your mailbox. You must not pay for this.[^1]

If you [lost your keys](/guides/lost-keys), or if you want keys for your friends or visitors, you must pay for them.

## How to get extra keys

### Regular keys

To get a key double, go to a locksmith (*Schlüsseldienst*) or to Bauhaus with the key you want to copy.[^12] It takes a few minutes. It costs around 5€ per key.

You can make as many copies of your apartment keys as you want. You do not need permission from your landlord, but you must inform them.[^15] You can give a copy of your apartment keys to anyone you want.[^5]

### Building keys

Building keys are harder to copy. Some keys have a protected shape, and only some locksmiths can copy them. Your *[[Hausverwaltung]]* might have a contract with a specific locksmith, so you must go to that locksmith.[^10]

There are two ways to copy building keys:

- **Get an unofficial copy** - 5€ to 35€ per key{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    Some locksmiths can replace building keys. You don't need permission or a code card.[^11] It's completely legal.[^2] You can send [Schlüsseldienst Samuel](https://www.schlüsseldienst-samuel.de/schl%C3%BCssel-ohne-karte/) a photo of your key on WhatsApp, and they tell you if they can copy it. They speak English, French and Arabic.[^14] [Key Copy](https://key-copy.com/) has a similar service.
- **Get an official copy** - 30€ to 80€ per key  
    Get permission from your *Hausverwaltung*. They will give you a letter (*Berechtigungsschein*) or a code card (*Sicherungskarte*). Bring it to the locksmith. Bring an ID document with you. It can take a few days.[^13]
