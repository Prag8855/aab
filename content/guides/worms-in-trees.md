In Berlin, when you a see a tree covered in small worms, they are probably ermine moth worms (*Gespinstmottenraupen*) or oak processionary worms (*Eichenprozessionsspinner*).

**Summary:** If the worms have hair on their backs, don't touch them. They are dangerous.

## Oak processionary worms

[Oak processionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_processionary) larvae (*Eichenprozessionsspinner*). You can find them in from May to July.[^0] They live in [large groups](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Thaumetopoea_processionea_68862604.jpg) on oak trees, and around them. They often move together in the same direction.

**These worms are dangerous** to you and your pets.[^1] **Do not touch them**. The hairs on their backs are toxic. They cause allergic reactions. They cause itchy, blistering [skin rashes](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oak_processionary_rash.JPG). The symptoms start after a day, and they can last for a few weeks.[^2] In some cases, they can cause more serious problems like fever, dizziness and breathing problems.[^3]

The city sometimes puts warning signs in parks, and even block roads.[^4] They also try to kill them with fire or vacuums.[^5]

## Ermine moth worms

[Ermine moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermine_moth) larvae (*Gespinstmottenraupen*) are around 3 centimetres long. They have smooth skin, and dark dots on their backs. You can find them from April to July.[^6] Just look for trees covered in silk.

Ermin moth larvae are not dangerous** to you or your pets, but they often kill the trees they invade.[^7] They sometimes hang from trees by their silk, so you can run into them.
