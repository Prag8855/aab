If you use public transit without a valid ticket, the [[BVG]] can give you a {{BVG_FINE|cur}}€ fine. This guide shows you what to do when you get a fine.

## How to reduce the fine

**Sometimes**. There are two conditions:[^0]

1. **You had a valid ticket**. For example, you have a BVG monthly ticket, but you forgot it at home. An unstamped ticket is not a valid ticket.
2. **and your ticket is not transferable**. This means that no one else can use it, because your name is written on it. For example, the student card (*Schülerticket*) is not transferable.[^1] Most other tickets are transferable.

If you meet both conditions, you can reduce your fine from {{BVG_FINE|cur}}€ to {{BVG_REDUCED_FINE|cur}}€.[^0] You must use [the BVG online self-service](https://www.bvg-ebe.de/en/selfservice/login). After you get the fine, you have 7 days to react. You can do it [online](https://www.bvg-ebe.de/en/), or at any BVG service centre. If you got a fine on the S-Bahn, you must go to a [[Deutsche Bahn]] service centre.

Even if you don't meet those conditions, you can try to get a reduced fine.[^2] Some people get lucky.

## Can I ignore a BVG fine?

**No!** If you ignore the fine, they will give it to a collection agency. The fine get more expensive.[^3] If you still don't to pay, you can go to jail.[^4]

Even if you live in another country, they sometimes try to collect the fine.[^5]

A BVG fine will not affect your visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application, even if you ignore it.

## How to pay the fine

### Do not pay the ticket checker

**If you are on a BVG bus, tram, or U-Bahn train**, don't give money to the ticket checker. BVG ticket checkers can't take your money. Some ticket checkers keep the money you give them.[^6] Some scammers pretend to be ticket checkers, and take your money. You can ask to see their BVG badge.

**If you are on the S-Bahn or the [[Deutsche Bahn]]**, you can pay the fine on the train. You can only pay by card.[^7] Don't pay with cash. Always ask for a receipt.

### Step 1. Find your EBE number

You must find your EBE number to pay your fine. It's written on your fine.[^0] It's a 13-digit number labelled *EBE-Nr*.

### Pay online

If you have a European bank account, you can [pay the BVG fine online](https://www.bvg-ebe.de/en/). You can also ask for a fine reduction online.

### Pay at a BVG Kundenzentrum

Bring your fine at one of the BVG and [[Deutsche Bahn]] customer service centres, wait in line and pay the fine. Make sure you keep the receipt.

### Pay by bank transfer

You can pay the fine with a [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). Just follow the [the instructions on this page](https://www.bvg-ebe.de/en/information-about-payments). You will not get a receipt from the BVG if you pay by bank transfer, so keep the transfer confirmation from your bank.

## What if I live in another country?

You should still pay the fine. If you live in Europe, you can still make a [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). If you don't live in Europe, you can use [Wise](/out/transferwise) to transfer money to the BVG.

## What if I lost the fine?

If you lost the fine and you don't know how to pay it, you can write to the BVG at <info@bvg.de>, or visit a BVG service centre.[^8]

In your email, include this information:

- The date when you got caught
- Train line or train number
- First name and last name
- Address
- Date of birth
