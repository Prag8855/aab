The **freelance visa** is a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) for self-employment in Germany.

With a freelance visa, you can...

- Live in Germany
- [Start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or [become a freelancer](/guides/become-a-freelancer-in-germany)
- Bring your family to Germany[^14]
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa[^13]
- Become a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 3 to 5 years[^10]

The **[artist visa](/glossary/Artist%20visa)** and the **language teacher visa** are the same thing as the freelance visa.[^8] The application process is the same.

This guide explains how to apply for a freelance visa in Berlin or in your country. In other German cities, the application process can be different.

## Who needs a freelance visa?

The freelance visa is a type of [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). You need a residence permit to live in Germany if you are not a citizen or permanent resident of the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), [[EEA]] or Switzerland.

**[Who needs a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit)**

Your current residence permit might allow self-employment. Look for these lines on your *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*:

- *[Erwerbstätigkeit erlaubt](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png)* (all occupations are allowed, including self-employment)[^15]
- *[Selbständige Tätigkeit gestattet](/images/aufenthaltstitel.jpg)* (self-employment is allowed)[^11]

If your [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or [[Blue Card]] allows self-employment, you can freelance part-time. To freelance full-time, you need a freelance visa.[^16]

## Freelance visa requirements

To get a freelance visa, you need...[^18]

- [ ] **A local economic interest**  
    You must have clients in Germany or support the German economy.[^71] This is very important. If you don't plan to have clients or employees in Germany, you might not get a freelance visa.[^68]
- [ ] **Enough income**  
    You must make enough money to support yourself. In Berlin, your income must be higher than your rent + your health insurance + {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month before taxes.[^53] The minimum income is different in other cities.
- [ ] **Self-employed work**  
    You must be self-employed.[^73] You can't be an employee with social benefits. [Fake self-employment](/glossary/Scheinselbstständigkeit) is not allowed.[^3] If you only have one client, you might not get a freelance visa.
- [ ] **Permission to do this job**  
    You must have all the permits and special qualifications needed for the job.[^12] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need special qualifications. - [Find the requirements for your profession](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)

If you are over 45 years old, and you are not a citizen of {{AUFENTHG_21_2_COUNTRIES}}, you must have...[^58]

- [ ] **A private retirement pension**  
    It must guarantee {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur}}€ per month for at least 12 years when you are 67 years old.[^59]
- [ ] or **a public pension**  
    If you are entitled to a public pension in Germany, Australia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chile, India, Israel, Japan, Canada, Kosovo, Morocco, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, South Korea, Tunisia, Turkey or the United States. You are entitled to a public pension in Germany if you already made 5 years of public pension payments.[^60]
- [ ] or **{{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_PENSION|cur}}€ in business assets**

**You do not need to speak German** to get a freelance visa.[^27]

**You do not need a degree**, except if your profession requires one. For example, you can't be a freelance lawyer without a law degree.[^12] - [Find the requirements for your profession](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)

## Freelance visa alternatives

Your current [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) might allow self-employment:

- **[[Work visa]]** or **[[Blue Card]]**  
    [Look on your *Zusatzblatt*](#who-needs-a-freelance-visa). Your work visa or Blue Card might let you work and freelance at the same time. Check your work contract; you might need permission from your employer to freelance.[^21] To freelance full-time, you need a freelance visa.
- **[[Student visa]]**  
    Your student visa does not allow self-employment by default.[^54] In Berlin, *some* student visas already allow self-employment.[^72] You can get permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* to study and freelance at the same time.[^2]
- **Other residence permits**  
    [Look on your *Zusatzblatt*](#who-needs-a-freelance-visa) to see if self-employment is allowed.
- **[Permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)** or **[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) citizenship**  
    You can already be self-employed. You don't need a freelance visa.

## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a freelance visa **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a freelance visa at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. You must apply at the *Ausländerbehörde* where you live. You can't apply in another city.

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]] for self-employment. You just need to [convert it to a freelance visa](#convert-your-national-visa-into-a-freelance-visa)

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

Usually, you can't start working before you get your freelance visa.[^35] Some people do it anyway. You might wait a few months with no income. It's cheaper and safer if you [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country), then come to Germany when you are allowed to work.

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and prepare your freelance visa application.

- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for clients, and apply for the freelance visa in Germany.[^9] You can't start working before you get your freelance visa. Some people do it anyway.
- **If you have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    Your current residence permit stays valid until you get your freelance visa. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon) after you sent your freelance visa application, you don't need to leave Germany.
- **If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**  
    You can't apply for a freelance visa with a tourist visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you must [apply for the freelance visa in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^19]

### 2. Prepare your freelance visa application

Before you apply for the freelance visa, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-one-address).
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. In Berlin, your income must be more than your rent + your health insurance + {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month before taxes.[^53]
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a freelance visa.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Many applications are rejected because of invalid health insurance.[^30] [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance. Their help is free. - [Health insurance options for a freelance visa](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    This takes a few weeks. Start as soon as you can.

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. You must prepare these documents too.

While you wait for an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung) and a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) (not a [tax number](/glossary/Steuernummer)). You need this to [register your business](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung). You might need a registration certificate to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), get a SIM card, find a [[Kita]] for your children, and use government services.
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#step-2-open-a-bank-account)**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your application fee, and get paid by your clients. You should open a separate bank account for your business. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

### 4. Apply for the freelance visa

There are 2 ways to apply for a freelance visa in Berlin:

- **Apply in person**  
    [Get an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment), go to your appointment, give your documents, and wait for your residence permit. It's almost impossible to get an appointment.
- or **send your documents online**  
    [Use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you. A few weeks later, they will give you an appointment. Usually, this is your only option.

**[How to get an Ausländerbehörde appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**

### 5. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. If you [send your documents online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait), it takes a few weeks to get invited for an appointment. After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your freelance visa. If you wait more than 3 months after you apply, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde).[^20]

In most cases, your current [[National Visa]] or a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. If your current residence permit does not allow self-employment, you must wait for your freelance visa to start your business.[^55]

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 6. Go to your freelance visa appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **The [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    Bring all your application documents, even if you already sent them online.[^47] In your appointment invitation, the *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more documents.
- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You must print it.
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin).
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€ application fee.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your freelance visa. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20Absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend.[^63] It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

The appointment takes 15 to 60 minutes.[^64] You spend most of that time waiting.

If they approve your freelance visa, they must print the plastic card. This takes a few weeks. You might get a [temporary certificate](/images/temporary-freelance-visa.jpg) while you wait. It allows you to start working, but it's not a valid travel document. It does not allow you to re-enter Germany.

**[What happens after your appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#after-your-appointment)**

### 7. Get your freelance visa

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment,[^22] you get 2 letters:

1. **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your freelance visa.
2. **Your freelance visa**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your freelance visa, or an invitation to collect it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^28] If you did not pay the {{ NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur }}€ fee, you must pay it during your *Ausländerbehörde* visit. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20Absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

Your freelance visa is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on it. It's **valid for up to 3 years**.[^17] If they are not sure that your business will work, you might get a shorter freelance visa.[^24]

You also get a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. It describes the conditions of your freelance visa. If you lived in Germany for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It allows you to be self-employed, and have a side job. - [More information](https://redtapetranslation.com/why-erwerbstatigkeit-gestattet-doesnt-always-mean-you-can-do-whatever-you-want/)

Check if the information on your freelance visa is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

    Some embassies and consulates ask for it.[^48] It's really hard to find an apartment before you arrive in Germany. Find a temporary place like a hotel room or a furnished apartment to get your National Visa.[^51] After you arrive in Germany, find an apartment where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)

**[How to start your business ➞](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**

### 6. Convert your National Visa into a freelance visa

Your National Visa is valid for 3 to 12 months.[^29] After your arrive in Germany, you must convert it into a freelance visa at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

In Berlin, you must convert your National Visa **8 weeks before it expires**, not sooner.[^39]

To convert your National Visa into a freelance visa:

1. **[Book an Ausländerbehörde appointment](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**

    During the appointment, they take your fingerprints for your freelance visa. It takes around 15 minutes.

4. **[Activate your eID](#activate-your-eid)** (optional)

Your freelance visa is a plastic card. It's valid for up to 3 years. You can [renew it](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa) before it expires.

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**.[^18] If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, embassy or consulate where you apply. - [Find your embassy or consulate](/out/consulate-finder)

**Your documents must convince the Ausländerbehörde** that your business will work, and that you will make enough money to support yourself.

**If you [apply online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait)**, use PDF files or photos. Word documents and other formats are unreliable.[^37] If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). You can also mail your documents.

**If you [apply in person](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#)**, bring everything. Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees look at every document. Some ignore half of them. You never know, so you must bring everything. Missing documents can delay your application by a few weeks. Print everything on A4 paper. Do not staple the pages together.

### Two types of freelance visa

There are two types of self-employed people. They get a different kind of freelance visa. **The [required documents](#required-documents) are different.**[^18]

- **Freelancers** (*[[Freiberufler]]*)  
    Artists, teachers, scientists, engineers, software developers and other professionals with special qualifications. If you sell professional services, you might be a freelancer. Delivery drivers, influencers, website operators, most photographers and some teachers are not freelancers.[^62]
- **Tradespeople** (*[Selbständiger](/glossary/Selbständig)/[[Gewerbetreibender]]*)

    You probably don't need a *Handelsregister* entry.[^77] If you need one, you can probably get it after you get your freelance visa. - [Who needs a *Handelsregister* entry?](/guides/handelsregisternummer-germany#who-needs-a-handelsregister-entry)

### Required documents if you apply in person

- [ ] **Appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment.
- [ ] **[Application form](/docs/residence-permit-application-form)** (*Antrag auf Erteilung eines Aufenthaltstitels*)  
    If this is your first residence permit application, you must fill this form.[^42] - [How to fill this form](https://www.essentialpackingchecklists.com/german-freelance-visa-application-form/)
- [ ] **Passport**  
    You get your passport back during your appointment; they do not keep it.[^75]
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    Only if apply in person. You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin).
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€ application fee.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your work visa. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20Absetzbar), so keep the receipt.

### Optional documents

These documents are not required, but some *Ausländerbehörde* employees ask for them. They make your application more convincing.

- [ ] **Resume** or **CV**  
    It proves that you have experience in your field. Remove irrelevant experience or summer jobs. Work experience is not required, but it helps.[^49]
- [ ] **Cover letter**  
    It explains what you do, and how your business works. It helps *Ausländerbehörde* employees understand your plan. This is very useful if your German is not good. Write it in German. - [Cover letter example](/docs/freelance-visa-cover-letter)
- [ ] **Portfolio** or **examples of your work**  
    It explains what you do. If you are an artist, this is very important.[^65] For example, you can bring photos of your work, posters of your events, screenshots of your website or apps or newspaper articles about you. You need printed examples; a website address does not work.[^50] If you can, fit everything on A4 paper.
- [ ] **Contracts**  
    It proves that you have guaranteed work. Signed contracts are better than [letters of intent](/glossary/Absichtserklärung). They should explain what you will do, how long you will work and how much you will get paid.
- [ ] **Letters of reference**  
    These are letters from your previous employers, clients or professors that recommend you for your work. If you are a scientist or researcher, this is very important.[^46] The letters must be related to the work you do.
- [ ] **Proof or education**  
    If your education is relevant to your business, prove it. Bring the original diplomas if you can. Copies also work.[^38]
- [ ] **Bank statements**  
    It shows how much savings you have.[^74] 3,000€ to 5,000€ in savings is enough. If possible, use a German bank.[^61] If it's in another currency, convert it to euros.

## After you get your freelance visa

### Bring your family to Germany

The [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) lets you bring your family to Germany. If they have a family reunion visa, your family members can work, freelance or start a business in Germany.

You can apply for it at the same time as your freelance visa.

### Activate your eID

You can use your freelance visa to log into online government services. For example, you need it for the *[[Gewerbeanmeldung]]*. You must activate this feature at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Activate your eID before you need it.**

**[How to activate your eID ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### Join the Künstlersozialkasse

**If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher**, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* after you get your freelance visa. They will pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung). It's a really good deal.

**[How to join the Künstlersozialkasse ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

### Renew your freelance visa

Your freelance visa is valid for up to 3 years. You must renew it around 8 weeks before it expires.

**[How to renew a freelance visa ➞](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)**

You can also apply for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 3 to 5 years.[^10]

### If you travel with a freelance visa

Your freelance visa lets you visit other [[Schengen area]] countries without a visa.

With a freelance visa, you can leave Germany for up to 6 months.[^23] To travel longer, you need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

### Make a tax declaration

Your immigration expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep all your receipts. Remember to include them when you make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). You will pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).

## Where to get help

An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions.

[Touring Artists](https://www.touring-artists.info/en/touring-artists/advice/our-helpdesk-service) helps artists immigrate and start a business. Their help is free. They speak English.

[German freelance visa help](https://www.facebook.com/groups/germanfreelancevisa/) is a useful Facebook group. People help each other with their freelance visa application.

**[Other places to ask immigration questions ➞](/guides/questions-about-berlin#immigration-questions)**

The *Ausländerbehörde* can answer your questions, but they are very hard to contact. They can take months to answer. Sometimes they don't answer at all.
