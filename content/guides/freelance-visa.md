## Freelance visa requirements

To get a freelance visa, you need...[^18]

- [ ] **Self-employed work**  
    You must be self-employed. You can't be an employee or receive social benefits. [Fake self-employment](/glossary/Scheinselbstständigkeit) is not allowed.[^3] If you only have one client, you might not get a freelance visa.
- [ ] **Clients in Germany**  
    Some of your clients must be in Germany. You need [letters of intent](/glossary/Absichtserkl%C3%A4rung) to prove that you will have German clients. If all your clients are in another country, you will not get a freelance visa.
- [ ] **Enough income**  
    You must make enough money to support yourself. In Berlin, your income must be higher than your rent + your health insurance + {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month.[^53] The minimum amount is different in other cities.[^53]
- [ ] **Qualifications for your work**  
    You must know how to do your job. For example, you can't be a freelance musician if you can't make music. You don't need professional training or a university degree.
- [ ] **Permission to do this job**  
    You must have all the permits and special qualifications needed for the job.[^56] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need special qualifications. - [Find the requirements for your profession](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)
- [ ] **A realistic business plan**  
    During your freelance visa interview, they check if your business makes sense. They check if you have enough money, and if your business contributes to the local economy.[^7]

If you are over 45 years old, you must have...[^14]

- [ ] **A retirement pension**  
    It must guarantee {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur}}€ per month for at least 12 years when you are 67 years old.
- [ ] or **{{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_PENSION|cur}}€ in assets**[^14]  
    You must have this much value in assets by the time you are 67 years old. {# What does that mean? #}

**You do not need to speak German** to get a freelance visa.[^27]

**You do not need a degree**, except if your profession requires one. For example, you can't be a freelance lawyer without a law degree. - [Find the requirements for your profession](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)

## Freelance visa alternatives

Your current [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) might allow self-employment:

- **[[Work visa]]** or **[[Blue Card]]**  
    Look on your *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. Your work visa or Blue Card might let you work and freelance at the same time. Check your work contract; you might need your employer's permission to freelance. To freelance full-time, you need a freelance visa.[^44]
- **[[Student visa]]**  
    Your student visa does not allow self-employment by default. The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* can allow you to study and freelance at the same time.[^2]
- **Other residence permits**  
    If you live in Germany for a few years, you might have an unrestricted residence permit. It lets you do any kind of work you want. Check your *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)* to see what you can do.
- **[Permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)** or **[EU](/glossary/European%20Union) citizenship**  
    You can already be self-employed. You don't need a freelance visa.

## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a freelance visa **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a freelance visa at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. You must apply at the *Ausländerbehörde* where you live. You can't apply in another city.

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]] for self-employment. You just need to [convert it to a freelance visa](#convert-your-national-visa-into-a-work-visa)

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

Usually, you can't start working before you get your freelance visa.[^35] You might wait a few months with no income. It's cheaper and safer if you [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country), then come to Germany when you are allowed to work.

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500 to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and prepare your freelance visa application.

- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for clients, and apply for the freelance visa in Germany.[^9] You can't work before you get your freelance visa.
- **If you have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    Your current residence permit stays valid until you get your freelance visa. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon) after you sent your freelance visa application, you don't need to leave Germany.
- **If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**  
    You can't apply for a freelance visa with a tourist visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you must [apply for the freelance visa in your country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^19]

### 2. Prepare your freelance visa application

Before you apply for the freelance visa, you must...

- [ ] **Find a place to live**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-one-address).
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. In Berlin, your income must be more than your rent, plus your health insurance, plus {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month.[^49]
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a freelance visa.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Get health insurance**  
    You need [valid health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-work-visa-or-blue-card). [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance. Their help is free. - [Health insurance options for a freelance visa](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    This takes a few weeks. Start as soon as you can.

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. You must prepare these documents too.

While you wait for an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **Register your address** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). You need this to [register your business](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung). You might need a registration certificate to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), get a SIM card, find a [[Kita]] for your children, and use government services. - [How to register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#step-2-open-a-bank-account)**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your freelance visa application fee, and get paid by your clients. You should open a separate bank account for your business. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

### 4. Apply for the freelance visa

There are 2 ways to apply for a freelance visa in Berlin:

- **Apply in person**  
    [Get an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment), go to your appointment, give your documents, and wait for your residence permit. It's almost impossible to get an appointment.
- or **send your documents online**  
    Use the [*Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you. A few weeks later, they will give you an appointment. Usually, this is your only option.

### 5. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. If you [send your documents online](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait), it takes a few weeks to get invited for an appointment. After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, it takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your freelance visa. If you wait more than 3 months after you apply, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde).[^20]

If you already have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), it stays valid while you wait. You don't have to leave Germany. You might not be able to travel outside of Germany. If your current residence does not allow self-employment, you must wait for your freelance visa to start your business.

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

### 6. Go to your freelance visa appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door.
- [ ] **1 biometric photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin).
- [ ] **The [required documents](#required-documents)**  
    If you did not send your application online, bring all your application documents.
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, MasterCard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the {{NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur}}€ application fee.[^44] You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your freelance visa. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20Absetzbar).
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend. It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.

The appointment takes around 15 minutes.

### 7. Get your freelance visa

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment,[^22] you get 2 letters:

1. **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. Save it for later. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your freelance visa.
2. **Your freelance visa**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your freelance visa, or an invitation to collect it at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^28] If you did not pay the {{ NATIONAL_VISA_FEE|cur }}€ fee, you must pay it during your *Ausländerbehörde* visit. The fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20Absetzbar).

Your freelance visa is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on it. It's **valid for up to 3 years**.[^17] You might get a shorter residence permit if they are not sure that your business will work.

You also get a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)* that describes the conditions of your freelance visa. If you lived in Germany for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It lets you do any kind of work you want.

Check if the information on your freelance visa is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.
