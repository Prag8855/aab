The freelance visa is a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) for self-employed immigrants.

With a freelance visa, you can...

- Live anywhere in Germany
- [Start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) or become a freelancer
- Bring your family to Germany[^14]
- Visit other [Schengen countries](/glossary/Schengen%20area) without a visa[^13]
- Become a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 3 to 5 years[^10]
- Become a citizen after 5 years

The **[artist visa](/glossary/Artist%20visa)** and the **language teacher visa** are the same thing as the freelance visa.[^8] The application process is exactly the same.

This guide explains how to apply for a freelance visa in Berlin or in your home country.

## Who needs a freelance visa?

If you are not a citizen of the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), [[EEA]] or Switzerland, you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live in Germany. The freelance visa is a type of residence permit.

If you are a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you don't need a freelance visa. You can already be self-employed.

**[Who needs a residence permit? ➞](/guides/residence-permit#who-needs-a-residence-permit)**

## Freelance visa requirements

To get a freelance visa, you need...[^18]

- [ ] **A local economic interest**  
    You must have clients in Germany, or hire German employees.[^71]
- [ ] **Enough income**  
    In Berlin, your [gross income](/glossary/Brutto%20income) must be more than your rent + your health insurance + {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month.[^53] If you support children or a spouse, you need a higher income.[^79]
- [ ] **Self-employed work**  
    You must be self-employed.[^73] You can't be an employee with social benefits. [Fake self-employment](/glossary/Scheinselbstständigkeit) is not allowed.[^3] If you only have one client, you might not get a freelance visa.
- [ ] **Permission to do this job**  
    You must have all the permits and special qualifications needed for the job.[^12] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need special qualifications. - [Find the requirements for your profession](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)

If you are over 45 years old, and you are not a citizen of {{AUFENTHG_21_2_COUNTRIES}}, you must have...[^58]

- [ ] **A private retirement pension**  
    Your pension must guarantee {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur}}€ per month for at least 12 years after you turn 67 years old.[^59]
- [ ] or **a public pension**  
    You need a guaranteed public pension in Germany, Australia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chile, India, Israel, Japan, Canada, Kosovo, Morocco, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, South Korea, Tunisia, Turkey or the United States.[^60] If you made 5 years of public pension payments in Germany, you have a guaranteed public pension.
- [ ] or **{{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_PENSION|cur}}€ in business assets**

**You do not need to speak German** to get a freelance visa.[^27]

**You do not need a degree** or relevant education, except [if your profession requires it](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession). For example, you need a law degree to be a lawyer, but you don't need a degree to be a freelance photographer.[^12]

If you can't get a freelance visa, there are [other residence permits](/guides/residence-permit#for-self-employment) to start a business in Germany. For example, you might qualify for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis).

**[Freelance visa alternatives ➞](/guides/residence-permit#for-self-employment)**

## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a freelance visa **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a freelance visa at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. If you don't live in Berlin, [find your local *Ausländerbehörde*](https://bamf-navi.bamf.de/de/Themen/Behoerden/) and apply there.
3. Get your freelance visa
4. Start your business

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you have an [EU Permanent Residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence) in another country
- **or** you have an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)[^4]
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]] for self-employment that you must [convert to a freelance visa](/guides/residence-permit#convert-your-national-visa)

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

Your current residence permit [might allow self-employment](/guides/residence-permit#for-self-employment). If not, you must wait for your freelance visa to start working.[^35] This can take [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). It might be cheaper and safer if you [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country), then come to Germany when you have permission to start your business.

**If you need help**, an [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500€ to 2,000€.[^45] It's a [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expense.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and prepare your freelance visa application.

- **If you have a [[National Visa]] or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    Your current visa or residence permit [might allow self-employment](/guides/residence-permit#for-self-employment). [If it expires](/guides/residence-permit#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires) after you applied for the freelance visa, you don't need to leave Germany. It stays valid until you get your freelance visa.
- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for clients, and apply for the freelance visa in Germany.[^9] You can't start working before you get your freelance visa. Some people do it anyway.
- **If you have an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)**  
    You can come to Germany, then convert your opportunity card into a freelance visa. You can't be self-employed with an opportunity card; you must wait for your freelance visa.[^11]
- **If you have a [[Schengen visa]]**  
    Schengen visas are for tourism, not immigration. You can't apply for a freelance visa with a Schengen visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you must [apply for the freelance visa in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^19]

### 2. Prepare your application

Before you apply for the freelance visa...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find your first apartment. It's much harder for freelancers. Start looking as soon as you can. Your only options might be a [[WG]] or a furnished apartment.[^29]
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). Your landlord must give you a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung). If you can't get a tenancy confirmation, you might not get a freelance visa.[^1]
    - [ ] Your rent must be affordable. In Berlin, your income must be more than your rent + your health insurance + {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur}}€ per month before taxes.[^53]
    - [ ] Your apartment must be big enough. You need 9 m^2^ per adult, and 6 m^2^ per child.[^80]
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Many applications are rejected because of invalid health insurance.[^30] [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance. Don't choose insurance yourself; it's a really bad idea. Many applications get rejected because people have the wrong health insurance.[^21]
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents ➞](#required-documents)**  
    This takes a few weeks. Start as soon as you can.

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. You must prepare their documents too.

While you wait for an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    [The *Anmeldung* is very important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address). When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). If you don't do your *Anmeldung*, they might reject your application.[^76]
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#open-a-bank-account)**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your application fee, and get paid by your clients. You should open a separate bank account for your business. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

### 3. Apply for the freelance visa

[Use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/immigration-office#how-to-contact-the-auslanderbehorde) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents). Send your application to the [correct department](/guides/immigration-office#departments). Choose departments E1 to E6, not B1 to B4.[^7]{{ fail_on('2025-03-01') }}

This is the only way. You can't go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment. You only get an appointment after you send your documents through the contact form.

**[How to send your application ➞](/guides/residence-permit#send-your-application)**

### 4. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. There is no way to track your application. You must wait for their response. It takes [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times).

While you wait, your current [[National Visa]] or residence permit might expire. It's extended until the *Ausländerbehörde* processes your application.

**[If your visa or residence permit expires ➞](/guides/residence-permit#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires)**

[If your current permit allows self-employment](/guides/residence-permit#for-self-employment), you can start your business already. If not, you must wait for your freelance visa.

**[What happens while you wait ➞](/guides/residence-permit#wait)**

### 5. Go to your appointment

[A few months later](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times), the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you an appointment date. If you get an appointment, you are almost guaranteed to get your freelance visa.

Follow the instructions in the email. You might need to send extra documents, or bring them to your appointment.

**[What happens during your appointment ➞](/guides/residence-permit#go-to-your-appointment)**

If your freelance visa is approved, you will get a second appointment to pick up your plastic residence card. While you wait, **you can start freelancing**. You will get [a document](/images/temporary-freelance-visa.jpg) that confirms this.[^20]

### 6. Get your freelance visa

Go to your second *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment and pick up your freelance visa. Your new freelance visa is valid for up to 3 years.[^17] You might get a shorter freelance visa if they are not sure that your business will work.[^24]

**[How to pick up your freelance visa ➞](/guides/residence-permit#pick-up-your-residence-card)**

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/freelanceVisa.html" %}

### 7. Start your business

**[How to start a business ➞](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**

**[What to do next ➞](#after-you-get-your-freelance-visa)**

## How to apply in your country

You can also apply for a freelance visa in your country, then move to Germany.[^26] This is **cheaper and safer**, because you can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany.[^34] You don't need to wait in Germany without an income.

**[How to apply in your country ➞](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-apply-in-your-country)**

You can also get an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte), move to Germany, then convert it into a freelance visa. You can't be self-employed with an opportunity card; you must wait for your freelance visa.[^11]

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**.[^18] If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, embassy or consulate where you apply. - [Find your embassy or consulate](/out/consulate-finder)

**Your documents must convince the Ausländerbehörde** that your business will work, and that you will make enough money to support yourself.

**[When you send your application](#apply-for-permanent-residence)**, use PDF files or photos. Don't use word documents or other file formats. If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). You can also [mail your documents](/guides/mail-a-letter), but it's not better or faster.

**[When you go to your appointment](#go-to-your-appointment)**, bring the documents that they ask for in your appointment confirmation.[^24] Print everything on A4 paper. Do not staple the pages together. Some case workers also ask for documents that you already sent. It's safer if you bring everything you have, including documents that you already sent.[^2]

### Two types of freelance visa

There are two types of self-employed people. They get a different kind of freelance visa. **The [required documents](#required-documents) are different.**[^18]

- **Freelancers** (*[[Freiberufler]]*)  
    Artists, teachers, scientists, engineers, software developers and other professionals with special qualifications. If you sell professional services, you might be a freelancer. Delivery drivers, influencers, website operators, most photographers and some teachers are not freelancers.[^62]
- **Tradespeople** (*[Selbständiger](/glossary/Selbständig)/[[Gewerbetreibender]]*)  
    If you are not a *Freiberufler*, you are *Selbständig*. If you sell products or apps, if you run a website, or if you are a co-founder, you are usually *Selbständig*.[^31]
