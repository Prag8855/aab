This guide explains how to start a business in Germany, step by step.

**This guide is for people who live in Germany.** If you want to move to Germany and become a freelancer, read [this guide](/guides/become-a-freelancer-in-germany) first.

This guide explains how to form a single proprietorship (*Einzelunternehmen*), not a corporation or a limited liability company (*UG* or *GmbH*).

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## How hard is it?

**It's not so bad.** It's a lot of work in the first year. There is a lot to learn, and a lot of paperwork to do. You must be organised. After a year or two, it's easier.

**If you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)** to live in Germany, it's harder because you must deal with the [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde). It takes a few months to [get a freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa), and you must renew it every few years. This adds a lot of costs, delays and paperwork.

**If you don't speak German**, it's much harder. You will need a lot of help. Important letters, online information and official forms are only in German. Most Bürgeramt, Ausländerbehörde and Finanzamt employees only speak German. If you have a problem, you need German to solve it.

## Cost of running a business

Your business should cover your [cost of living](/guides/cost-of-living) and let you save money for retirement.

### Personal taxes

As a German resident, you must pay these taxes:

- [Income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer)
- [Health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung) and [nursing care insurance](/glossary/Pflegeversicherung)
- [Church tax](/glossary/Kirchensteuer)
- [Solidarity surcharge](/glossary/Solidaritätszuschlag)
- [Unemployment insurance](/glossary/Arbeitslosenversicherung) (optional)
- [Public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung) (optional)

{% include "_blocks/taxCalculator.html" %}

If you are self-employed, **you must earn more than an employee** to get the same [net income](/glossary/Netto%20income) and benefits. Your health insurance, pension insurance and unemployment insurance are twice as expensive, because your employer does not pay half of it.

Unemployment and pension insurance are optional. If you don't pay for it, you don't get unemployment benefits, and you must plan for your own retirement.

**[How taxes work in Germany ➞](/guides/taxes)**

### Trade tax

If you run a *[[Gewerbe]]*, you must pay the trade tax (*[[Gewerbesteuer]]*). In Berlin, it's a {{ GEWERBESTEUER_MESSBETRAG * (GEWERBESTEUER_HEBESATZ_BERLIN - GEWERBESTEUER_TAX_CREDIT) }}% tax on all [profit](/glossary/Gewinn) above {{GEWERBESTEUER_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per year.

If you are a *[[Freiberufler]]*, you don't pay the trade tax.

**[Are you a Freiberufler or a Gewerbe? ➞](/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe)**

**[How the trade tax works ➞](/guides/gewerbesteuer)**

### IHK membership

If you run a *[[Gewerbe]]* in Berlin, you are forced to join the [[IHK]]. The mandatory membership fee is a percentage of your [revenue](/glossary/Umsatz). It costs a few hundred euros per year.

**[IHK membership fee calculator ➞](https://www.ihk.de/berlin/ueber-uns/mitgliedschaft-und-beitrag/das-verfahren-der-beitragserhebung/beitragsberechnung-2280534)**

### Value Added Tax (VAT)

Value added tax (VAT or *[[Umsatzsteuer]]*) is a {{VAT_RATE}}% tax on goods and services. Usually, you must charge VAT on your invoices, and you pay VAT on your expenses.

If you receive more VAT than you give, you must give the extra money to the *[[Finanzamt]]*. If you give more VAT than you receive, the Finanzamt gives you the difference back. You don't win or lose any money with VAT.

**[How VAT works in Germany ➞](/guides/value-added-tax)**

Small businesses (*[[Kleinunternehmer]]*) can choose not to charge VAT. It simplifies things, but [it's not always a good idea](/guides/kleinunternehmer#should-you-be-a-kleinunternehmer).

**[How being a Kleinunternehmer works ➞](/guides/kleinunternehmer)**

### Tax advisor and bookkeeping

Tax advisors are worth it. They handle your taxes and most of your paperwork. They can prevent expensive mistakes, and solve problems with the *[[Finanzamt]]*. You *must* have a tax advisor to [renew your freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa).

A tax advisor costs **700€ to 2,000€ per year** if you charge [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer), or 300€ to 800€ per year if you don't. The prices vary a lot. The only way to know is to call and ask.

Tax software is cheaper than a tax advisor. [Sorted](/out/sorted-taxes) and [Lexware Office](/out/lexoffice) help with invoicing and VAT reporting. You can do your tax declaration in [[ELSTER]]. I use Lexware Office for all of my bookkeeping, but I still have a tax advisor.

**[List of English-speaking tax advisors ➞](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin)**

**[List of German tax software ➞](/guides/german-tax-software)**

Some banks like [Qonto](/out/qonto), [Holvi](/out/holvi) and [Kontist](/out/kontist) can also make your accounting easier. I use Kontist as my business bank.

### Other business expenses

If you run a business, you can get insurance against disability, lawsuits, mistakes, and other problems. This is optional. You could also need tools, equipment and office space.

**[Types of insurance in Germany ➞](/guides/insurance)**

You can deduct all of your business expenses. This allows you to pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).

## Before you start

### Register your address

In Germany, you must [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin) every time you move. It's called the *[Anmeldung](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)*.

When you register your address for the first time, you get a tax ID (*[[Steueridentifikationsnummer]]*). You need a registered address and a tax ID to [create an ELSTER account](/guides/elster-account) and [register your business at the *Finanzamt*](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung).

**[How to register your address in Berlin ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

**[How to get a tax ID ➞](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id)**

### Open a bank account

You need a bank account to pay taxes, pay for health insurance, and to get paid by your customers. You can use any European bank.[^0]

**Use a separate bank account** for your business. Bookkeeping is easier when your personal and business transactions are separate. Some banks don't let you use your personal account for business.[^2]

Business banks like [Holvi](/out/holvi), [Qonto](/out/qonto), [Kontist](/out/kontist) and [Finom](/out/finom) help with your accounting. I use [Kontist](/out/kontist) since January 2022, but [I don't recommend it](/guides/kontist-review).

**[Best German banks for expats ➞](/guides/best-bank-germany)**

**The [[Finanzamt]] can freeze your bank accounts** if you don't pay your taxes. They will freeze all of your accounts, not just your business account. They can also freeze your accounts in other EU countries.[^3] When the *Finanzamt* freezes your bank account, you can't withdraw money or make bank transfers.[^4]

Sometimes, they freeze your account by mistake. It happened to me, and to other people I know. Even if it's not your fault, it can take a few days to fix. During that time, you can't withdraw money.

**Get a P-Konto** (*[[Pfändungsschutzkonto]]*). It lets you access some of your money when your account is frozen, so you can buy food and pay your bills. You can get a *P-Konto* for free, but it can affect your *[[Schufa]]* score.

### Find a tax advisor

A tax advisor can [register your business at the *Finanzamt*](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung) and [at the *Gewerbeamt*](/guides/gewerbeschein), and prepare your [tax declarations](/glossary/Steuererklärung). They make accounting easier, and they prevent expensive mistakes.

You need a tax advisor to [renew a freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa). They must prepare and stamp some of the required documents.

It's hard to find a tax advisor. It can take a few weeks.

**[English-speaking tax advisors in Berlin ➞](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin)**

## Steps to start your business

### 1. Know if you are a Freiberufler or a Gewerbe

There are two kinds of self-employed people: freelancers (*[[Freiberufler]]*) and tradespeople (*[Gewerbetreibende](/glossary/Gewerbetreibender)*). **The difference is important.**

Tradespeople must...

- [Get a trade licence](/guides/gewerbeschein) (*[[Gewerbeschein]]*)
- [Pay the trade tax](/guides/gewerbesteuer) (*[[Gewerbesteuer]]*)
- Get listed in the *Handelsregister* ([in some cases](/guides/handelsregisternummer-germany#who-needs-a-handelsregister-entry))
- Use double entry bookkeeping ([in some cases](/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe#double-entry-bookkeeping))

When you [apply for a freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa) or [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), the required documents are different for *Freiberufler* and *Gewerbetreibende*

Not all freelancers are *Freiberufler*, only people in [specific professions](https://www.ihk.de/hamburg/produktmarken/beratung-service/recht-und-steuern/steuerrecht/real-kommunale-steuern/abgrenzung-gewerbebetrieb-freie-berufe-1157144#titleInText8). For example, designers, engineers, doctors, architects, teachers, artists and journalists.

**[Freiberufler or Gewerbe, what's the difference? ➞](/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe)**

### 2. Get a trade licence

If you register as a *[[Gewerbe]]*, you must get a trade licence (*[[Gewerbeschein]]*) before you [register your business](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung) with the *[[Finanzamt]]*.

In Berlin, you can [apply for a *Gewerbeschein* online](/guides/gewerbeschein). You need a valid [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) before you do this. In the rest of Germany, you can use the paper form. Your tax advisor can also do it for you.

**[What is the trade tax? ➞](/guides/gewerbesteuer)**

**[How to get a trade licence in Berlin ➞](/guides/gewerbeschein)**

### 3. Register with the Finanzamt

The next step is to declare your business to the *[[Finanzamt]]*. You must [fill the *Fragebogen zur steuerlichen Erfassung*](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung) online. It takes 5 to 7 weeks,[^9] including 1 week to [create an ELSTER account](/guides/elster-account).

Your [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater) can register your business for you. If you don't speak German, use Sorted's [free tool to register your business](/out/sorted-fragebogen). I tried it; it's really good.

**[How to register a business in Germany ➞](/guides/fragebogen-zur-steuerlichen-erfassung)**

### 4. Get a residence permit

You might need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to be self-employed in Germany. It depends on your nationality. It takes around 3 months to get a residence permit, sometimes longer.

**[Who needs a residence permit? ➞](/guides/residence-permit)**

**[How to apply for the German freelance visa ➞](/guides/freelance-visa)**

### 5. Tell your health insurer

If you already have [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung), tell your insurance company that you will be self-employed.

When you are an employee, health insurance payments are taken from your salary. If you are self-employed, you pay every month by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung).

Health insurance for freelancers is more expensive, because your employer does not pay half of it.

{% include '_blocks/healthInsuranceCalculator.html' %}

If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), the cost of your insurance depends on your income. Since you don't know your future income, they use your *estimated* income. If you pay too much for insurance, you will get a refund later. If you don't pay enough, you will get an invoice later.

If you are self-employed, [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) could be a lot cheaper. Since I switched to private, I save over 400€ per month, and I have *better* coverage. Talk to a [health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) about it. It's not a simple decision.

**[How to choose health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

### 6. Get financial help

The state can help you start a business. There are many options:

- **Training voucher** (*[AVGS](/glossary/Aktivierungs-%20und%20Vermittlungsgutschein)* or *[[Bildungsgutschein]]*)  
    If you are unemployed, you can get free coaching or training. It's paid by the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]*. There are [hundreds of different classes](https://web.arbeitsagentur.de/coachingundaktivierung/suche?mz=SA%2004&uk=Bundesweit&pg=0&re=BE) for business owners, including German classes.
- **Start-up grant** (*Gründungszuschuss*)  
    If you get *[[ALG I]]*, the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* can give you more money to help you start your business. Ask them when you [register for unemployment benefits](/guides/unemployment-benefits).
- **Initial funding** (*Einstiegsgeld*)  
    If you already get [[Bürgergeld]], the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* can give 50% more money to help you start your business.[^10] More information [here](https://redtapetranslation.com/algii-and-einstiegsgeld-a-government-grant-to-start-your-business/).
- **Investment grant** (*Investitionszuschuss*)  
    If you already get [[Bürgergeld]], the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* can give you up to 5,000€ to buy equipment for your business.[^11]
- **EXIST start-up grant**  
    If you are a student, a graduate or a scientist working in an innovative technology, you can apply for this grant. - [More information](https://www.exist.de/EXIST/Navigation/EN/Start-upFunding/EXIST-Business-Start-up-Grant/exist-business-start-up-grant.html)

You can apply for a training voucher, initial funding and an investment grant at the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* or the *[[Jobcenter]]*. You might not get a training voucher if you don't qualify for [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).[^12]

## What to do next

### Update your website

If you have a website, it must follow German and European laws. If you make a mistake, you can get an *[[Abmahnung]]* and waste a lot of money.

**[How to run a website in Germany ➞](/guides/website-compliance-germany)**

### Join the Künstlersozialkasse

If you are an artist, publicist or art teacher, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]*. They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your public pension insurance. It's a really good deal.

**[How to join the Künstlersozialkasse ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

### Do your taxes

Every year, you must make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). Remember that most business expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar): tax advisor, tax software, insurance, transportation, computers, internet, mobile phone, banking fees, part of your rent and a lot more. This reduces your taxable income, so you pay less taxes.

## Need help?

There are tools that make it easier:

- **Tax registration**  
    Your [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater) can register your business for you. [Sorted's registration tool](/out/sorted-fragebogen) lets you do it in English. There are [people who can help you](/guides/questions-about-berlin#business-questions), even in English.
- **Accounting**  
    Your tax advisor can do your accounting. Tax software like [Accountable](/out/accountable), [Lexware Office](/out/lexoffice) and [Sorted](/out/sorted-taxes) help with invoicing and VAT reporting. Accountable and Sorted are in English. Some banks like [Kontist](/out/kontist), [Holvi](/out/holvi) and [Qonto](/out/qonto) also make your bookkeeping easier.
- **Speaking German**  
    Your tax advisor can talk with the *Finanzamt* for you. [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation) can help you write letters in German. German-speaking friends can help you too.
