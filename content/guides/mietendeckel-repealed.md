Short_title: The Mietendeckel
Description: The Mietendeckel was repealed. You might have to give the money you saved back, but there are other ways to reduce your rent.

*This guide is old. It probably does not apply to you.*

On April 15 2021, Berlin's rent cap (*Mietendeckel*) was declared unconstitutional. This means the *Mietendeckel* was never valid. If your rent was reduced because of the *Mietendeckel*, it could go back up. If you saved money with the *Mietendeckel*, you might have to give it back.

In this guide, I explain what will happen, what you can do, and how you can still lower your rent. This guide will be updated when there is new information.

## What was the Mietendeckel?

The *[[Mietendeckel]]* was a rent control law in Berlin. It set rent limits in each area, and it stopped all rent increases for 5 years. If a landlord charged too much rent, they could get a big fine.

It came in effect on January 30 2020, and the rent reductions started on November 23 2020.[^0] Hundreds of thousands of people got their rent reduced. Some saved hundreds of euros per month.

The *Mietendeckel* is not the same as the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]*, another rent control law. The *Mietpreisbremse* is still there.[^1] It will not go away.

## What happened?

On April 15 2021, the constitutional court said that the *Mietendeckel* is unconstitutional.[^2] Berlin did not have the right to make this law, so it was never valid.[^3] Because of this, many people must pay back the money they saved with the *Mietendeckel*.[^1]

On April 20 2021, Berlin said that it will help people who can't pay their landlords back.[^4] The city will offer millions of euros in financial help, and dozens of new case workers.

## What should I do?

### 1. Check your lease

If you signed a lease after June 19 2020, or if your rent was reduced because of the *Mietendeckel*, look for a *[[Schattenmiete]]* clause in your lease. This shows how much rent you must pay if the *Mietendeckel* is repealed.

- **If you signed a lease before June 19, 2019**
    - **...and your rent was reduced by the Mietendeckel**  
        You might have to give the money back. It's complicated.[^5] It depends on how your lease is phrased.[^5] You should [get legal help](/guides/mietendeckel-repealed#where-can-i-get-help). In the meantime, talk with your landlord, and [give the money back with reservations](/guides/mietendeckel-repealed#give-the-money-back).
    - **...and your rent was not reduced**  
        You do not need to pay anything. Your rent will not go up. Nothing changes.
- **If you signed a lease after June 19, 2019**
    - **...and your lease has a [[Schattenmiete]] clause**  
        You must give the money you saved back to your landlord.[^4] Give the money back in the next 14 days (before April 30).[^1] Do not wait until your landlord asks for it.[^6] After April, you must pay the higher rent.
    - **...and your lease does not have a [[Schattenmiete]] clause**  
        If your rent was reduced without any conditions, then you can keep the money,[^7] and your rent will not go up.[^5] If you are not sure, talk to your landlord, and [get legal help](/guides/mietendeckel-repealed#where-can-i-get-help).

In some cases, *Schattenmiete* clauses are not valid.[^4] Get your lease checked by a lawyer, tenant's union, or a tenant counsel. They can help you understand if you must pay your landlord back.

If you need help to read your lease, [there are people who can help you](/guides/mietendeckel-repealed#where-can-i-get-help).

### 2. Talk to your landlord

If you must give the money you saved back, talk to your landlord or *Hausverwaltung* first. Some want the money back now. Others let you pay it back in instalments (little by little).[^1] Others don't want the money back.

These housing companies don't want the money back:[^8]

- Degewo
- Gesobau
- Gewobag
- Howoge
- Vonovia
- Stadt und Land
- Wohnungsbaugesellschaft Berlin-Mitte (WBM)

If you can't give the *Mietendeckel* money back now, you can negotiate with your landlord.[^1] For example, you can ask to pay it back in instalments (*Ratenzahlung*).[^9] The Berlin Senate also offers an [interest-free loan](https://www.ibb.de/de/immobilienfoerderung/themen/mietendeckel/mietendeckel.html) (*Sicher-Wohnen-Hilfe*) to help you pay your landlord back.[^1]

### 3. Give the money back (with reservations)

By default, you must return the money now. That means maximum April 30.[^1] Do not wait until the landlord asks for it.[^10] If you talk with your landlord, they could give you more time to pay.

**Make the payment with reservations**.[^11] When you transfer the money, include "*ohne Anerkennung einer Rechtspflicht*" in the payment description.[^12] If you return the money without reservations, it means that you agree with the higher rent. It makes it harder to lower your rent again with the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]*.[^13] You should also [send a letter of reprimand](https://www.conny.legal/en/rent/rent-freeze?utm_source=allaboutberlin) (*qualifizierte Rügeschreiben*) to oppose the higher rent. These steps will help you later, if you lower your rent with the *Mietpreisbremse*.

**If you receive housing benefits** (SGB II, or SGB XII chapter 4), contact the *Jobcenter* or *Sozialamt*. If you must pay your landlord back, they will cover the costs.[^14] You must apply for it in April, not later.[^15]

**If you receive asylum seeker benefits**, contact the *Landesamt für Flüchtlingsangelegenheiten*. If you must pay your landlord back, they will cover the costs.[^16]

**If you have a low income**, you can get an [interest-free loan](https://www.ibb.de/de/immobilienfoerderung/themen/mietendeckel/mietendeckel.html) from the city (the *Sicher-Wohnen-Hilfe*). This helps you pay back your landlord now, but you must still pay the loan back.[^17] To get this loan, your household must earn less than the income limit:[^18]

- 1 person living alone: less than 33,600€ per year
- 2 people living together: 50,400€ per year in total
- 3 people living together: 61,880€ per year in total
- 4 people living together: 73,360€ per year in total
- 5 people living together: 84,840€ per year in total
- 6 people living together: 96,320€ per year in total

### 4. Pay the new rent

If your rent goes up, you must pay the higher rent. You don't have a choice. Do not wait until your landlord tells you.[^19]

The new rent does not let you end your lease. If you want to [move somewhere else](/guides/moving-out), you must still give a 3 month notice.[^1]

**If you receive housing benefits or asylum seeker benefits**, your higher rent is still covered.[^20]

### 5. Get your rent reduced again

The *Mietendeckel* is gone, but the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]* still works.[^19] It's an older rent control law. With the *Mietpreisbremse*, you can lower your rent for the months since April 2020, and for the future months.

The *Mietpreisbremse* does not cover all apartments, and it can take a long time to get a reduction, but you should still try. If you were covered by the Mietendeckel, there's a 70% chance that you are covered by the *Mietpreisbremse*. If your cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) is 10% over the [*Mietspiegel* price](https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/wohnen/mietspiegel/), you can lower your rent.

There are many ways to get your rent reduced with the *[[Mietpreisbremse]]*:

- Your **tenants' association** (*[[Mieterverein]]*) can check your lease, and tell you if you pay too much rent. They can also help you ask for a rent reduction. You must be a member to use this service. It costs around 10€ per month.
- **[Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse)** specialises in reducing your rent with the *Mietpreisbremse*. You only pay if they are successful. I wrote a [review of this service](/guides/wenigermiete-review).
- A **lawyer**. Use my [list of English-speaking lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin). If you have legal insurance (*[[Rechtsschutzversicherung]]*), you can get their advice for free. If you don't have legal insurance, this option can be very expensive, especially if you must go to court.

## Questions and answers

### Can I move out?

**Yes**. You can [move somewhere else](/guides/moving-out), but you must still give a 3 month notice.[^1] Your lease does not end faster because of the *Mietendeckel*.[^21]

### Can my landlord kick me out?

**If you don't pay what you owe, yes**. The rules are the same as before: if you owe more than 2 month's rent, your landlord can kick you out without delay.[^13]

This means that if you don't return the money you saved with the *Mietendeckel*, or you don't pay your new rent after April 2021, you could get in trouble.

### If I moved, do I have to give money back?

**Yes**. If your rent was reduced with the *Mietendeckel*, and you moved somewhere else, you still need to return the money. It does not make a difference.
