## How to write German phone numbers

A German phone number has 3 parts: the **country code**, the **area code**, and the **rest of the phone number**.

Take this number for example: **+49 30 901820**.

- **+49** is the country code (*Ländervorwahl*) for Germany.[^0] The "+" important. If you can't dial "+49" on your phone, dial "0049" instead. 004930901820 is the same as +4930901820.
- **30** is the area code (*Vorwahl*). The area code for Berlin is **30**,[^1] but cellphones have different area codes. - [Full list of area codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialling_codes_in_Germany).
- **901820** is the rest of the phone number. It can have more digits, or fewer digits.

You can write the same number without a country code. Just add "0" in front of it: 030 901820.

Here is another number: +49 1522 3433333

- **+49** is the country code (*Ländervorwahl*) for Germany
- **1522** is the area code (*Vorwahl*) for a Vodaphone mobile phone.
- **3433333** is the rest of the phone number.

You can write the same number without a country code. Just add "0" in front of it: 01522 3433333.

## How to dial German phone numbers

There are 3 ways to call a German phone number:

- **Dial the whole number**  
    For example, **+49 152 901820** or **0049 152 901820**. You must put a **+** or a **00** in front of the number. When you call from another country, dial the whole number.
- **Dial the regional number**  
    For example, **030 901820**. You must put a 0 in front of the number. When you call from Germany, you can dial the regional number.
- **Dial the local number**  
    For example, **901820**. When you call from the same area, dial the local number.

## Special phone numbers

### Emergency numbers

**[Emergency numbers in Germany ➞](/guides/emergency-numbers)**

### Toll-free numbers

If a number starts with **0800**, it's a toll-free (*gebührenfrei*) number. For example, 0800 285 85 85. Toll-free numbers are completely free for the caller.[^2] Your mobile phone company won't charge you anything.

There are 2 ways to call German toll-free numbers:

- **Without the country code**  
    For example, **0800 285 85 85**. This will work from anywhere in Germany.
- **With the country code**  
    If you call from another country, put the country code before the number, and remove the first 0. For example, **+49 800 285 85 85** or **0049 800 285 85 85**.

Some toll-free numbers don't work with Skype, or don't let you call from another country.[^3]

### Premium numbers

If a number starts with **0900** or **0137**, it's a premium number.[^4] When you call premium numbers, you pay a fee. For example, **0900 1 5293 6611** is a legal hotline that costs 2€ per minute. The cost is charged on your phone bill.
