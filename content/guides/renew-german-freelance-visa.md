This guide shows you how to **renew** a [German freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) before it expires. To apply for a new German freelance visa, read [this guide](/guides/how-to-get-a-german-freelance-visa).

This guide was written for freelancers in Berlin. If you live in another city, the process can be a little different.

## Freelance visa renewal process

To renew a German freelance visa, you must...

1. Gather the [required documents](#required-documents)
2. [Get an appointment at the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)
3. Go to your appointment
4. Wait for your new residence permit

**Start to prepare 3 to 6 months before your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) expires**. You need time to gather the documents. Some documents must be verified by a (*[[Steuerberater]]*). If you don't have a tax advisor, or if your finances are not organised, you need more time.

A [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can help you renew your residence permit. They can help you prepare your documents, find an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, and go to the appointment with you.

### 0. Check if you can renew your visa

**When:** Before you start

When you renew your freelance visa, they verify that...

- **You make enough money**  
    They will check your invoices and your *Steuerbescheid* to verify your income. You must make enough money to support yourself.[^0]
- **You have clients in Germany**  
    You must have some invoices from clients in Germany.[^0] If all your income comes from other countries, you can't renew your freelance visa.
- **You have valid health insurance**  
    This time, you can't have cheap [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). You must have valid public or private health insurance. There is more information about this [below](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa#get-valid-health-insurance).
- **You have a retirement plan**  
    If you are over 45 years old, you must prove that you will get a pension of at least {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur}}€ per month for at least 12 years, or that you have {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_PENSION|cur}}€ in assets.[^0] This is not required for citizens of the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the United States.[^1]

If you don't meet those requirements, you can't renew your freelance visa.

These are the same requirements as when you apply for a freelance visa for the first time.[^15]

### 1. Find if you are self-employed, or freelance

**When:** Before you start

The required documents are different for freelancers (*[[Freiberufler]]*) and for tradespeople (*[Gewerbetreibende](/glossary/Gewerbetreibender)*).

- If you see "§ 21 Abs. 5" [on your residence permit](/images/freelance-visa-germany-type.png), you are *[[Freiberufler]]*.
- If you see "§ 21 Abs. 1" or "§ 21 Abs. 2a" [on your residence permit](/images/freelance-visa-germany-type.png), you are a *Selbständiger*/*[[Gewerbetreibender]]*.

Note: Immigration law uses the term "*Selbständiger*", and business law uses "*Gewerbetreibender*". These words mean the same thing.[^16]

### 2. Get valid health insurance

**When:** 3 months before your visa appointment

When you renew a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) like Mawista or Care Concept is rarely accepted.[^2] You need a real public or private health insurance.

**[Health insurance for a freelance visa ➞](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-freelance-visa)**

It usually takes 1 or 2 weeks to switch to another health insurance. In some cases, it takes up to 3 months. A [health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) can help you choose health insurance, and fill the paperwork for you. Their help is free.

{% include 'blocks/_healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

**[How to choose German health insurance ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance)**

### 3. Find a tax advisor

**When:** 2-5 months before your visa appointment

You need a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater). They must prepare documents for you:

- If you are a *[[Freiberufler]]*, you need a *[[Netto-Gewinnermittlung]]*. You can prepare it yourself, but it must be verified and stamped by a tax advisor.[^3]
- If you are a *[[Gewerbetreibender]]*, you need a *[[Prüfungsbericht]]*. It must be verified and stamped by a tax advisor.

**[Difference between Freiberufler and Gewerbetreibender ➞](/guides/freiberufler-or-gewerbe)**

**If you already have a tax advisor**, and your finances are organised, you can get these documents in a few days. If your finances are not organised, it can take a few weeks.

**If you don't have a tax advisor**, you need a few weeks to find one. Use my [list of English-speaking tax advisors in Berlin](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin).

### 4. Get an Ausländerbehörde appointment

**When:** at least 3 months before your residence permit expires

Get an appointment at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Book your appointment as soon as possible**. It's really hard to find an appointment. It can take months to find one. The nearest appointment can be in a few months.

**[Book an appointment ➞](/out/auslanderbehorde-appointment?t=renew)**

**[Other ways to get an appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment)**

For the freelance visa, you must go to the [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer *Ausländerbehörde*](https://service.berlin.de/standort/121885/), not the one on Keplerstraße.

If you can't find an appointment, you can also [apply by email](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#by-email). It's often the only way, because there are no appointments.

**[If your visa expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon)**

### 5. Gather the required documents

**When:** 1-3 months before your appointment

Start gathering the required documents as soon as possible. Some documents take time to prepare. If you don't have a tax advisor, or if your finances are not organised, it takes more time.

If your documents are not in English or German, you might need certified translations. This takes more time and money.

Go to the **[list of required documents ↓](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa#required-documents)**

### 6. Find a translator

**When:** 2-4 weeks before your appointment

Many *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* employees only speak German.[^4] They will ask many questions. You must speak German, or bring a translator with you. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](https://redtapetranslation.com/). I have worked with them many times. [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) can also go to the *Ausländerbehörde* with you.

### 7. Go to your Ausländerbehörde appointment

**[What happens during your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

During your appointment, 3 things can happen:

- **If you have all the right documents**, you will get a new visa. It will be valid for 1-3 years.
- **If your documents are not convincing**, you could get a shorter visa, usually 1 year.
- **If some documents are missing**, you will not get a visa. You will get a new appointment. You must go home, get the missing documents, and come back for your next appointment. If your current visa is expired, you will receive a temporary visa (*[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*).

In total, you will spend around 1 hour at the *Ausländerbehörde*.

### 8. Receive your new residence permit

**[If your visa application is approved ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-application-is-approved)**

**[If your visa application is rejected ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-application-is-rejected)**

## Required documents

Bring these documents to your visa interview. [The official list of documents](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324288/en/) is not complete. *Ausländerbehörde* employees often ask for things that are not in this list.

- [ ] **Appointment confirmation** (optional)  
    This document shows you where to go for your appointment. It also contains your waiting number (*Vorgangsnummer*). You might have to show this document before you enter the *Ausländerbehörde*. You can also keep this document on your phone. You do not need to print it.
- [ ] **Passport**  
    The passport must still be valid. It must have two free pages for your new residence permit. If your residence permit is in an older passport, bring the old passport and the new one. You do not need to have empty pages in your passport. They do not put stickers in your passport anymore. Your new residence permit will be a [plastic card](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/aufenthalt/elektronischer-aufenthaltstitel/).
- [ ] **Current residence permit**  
    If you have a plastic residence permit, bring it. If your residence permit is in an older passport, bring the old passport and the new one.
- [ ] **1 passport photo**  
    You need a 35 × 45 mm biometric picture. [There are many ways to get biometric photos in Berlin](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin). There is a photo booth at the *Ausländerbehörde*,[^5] but you should get a picture in advance. You do not need to cut the passport photos yourself; they have a tool for this.[^6]
- [ ] **Proof of sufficient income**  
    You must prove that you make enough income to support yourself in Berlin.
    - **[If you are self-employed](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa#find-if-you-are-self-employed-or-freelance)** (*[[Gewerbetreibender]]*), bring these documents:
        - [ ] **Audit report form** (*[[Prüfungsbericht]]*)  
            The document [on this page](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324288/) must be filled and stamped by a tax advisor (*[[Steuerberater]]*). It can take a few days to prepare. If your finances are not organised, it can take a few weeks.
        - [ ] **and a proof of business registration** (*aktuelle Handelsregisterauszug*)  
            You must prove that you are registered in the *[[Handelsregister]]*. Request it [in person, in writing](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/327144/standort/326311/), or [online](https://www.handelsregister.de/rp_web/welcome.do). It costs 10€.[^7] If you are a *[[Kleinunternehmer]]*, this document is not required, because you don't have to be in the *Handelsregister*. It can take a few days to receive this document.
        - [ ] **and a copy of your trade certificate** ([*Gewerbeschein*](/guides/gewerbeschein))  
            You get this document during your business registration (*[[Gewerbeanmeldung]]*).
        - [ ] **and a certification of tax-related matters** (*Bescheinigung in Steuersachen* or *Unbedenklichkeitsbescheinigung*)  
            This proves that you paid your taxes to the *Finanzamt*. You can request it in writing from the *[[Finanzamt]]* where your business is registered. It costs 17.90€.[^8] It can take a few days to arrive.
    - **[If you are a freelancer](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa#find-if-you-are-self-employed-or-freelance)** (*[[Freiberufler]]*), you don't need a *[[Prüfungsbericht]]*.[^9] Bring these documents instead:
        - [ ] **Tax assessments** (*[[Steuerbescheid]]*)  
            When you make a tax declaration, the *[[Finanzamt]]* sends you a *[[Steuerbescheid]]* by post. It looks like [this](/images/Einkommensteuer-Bescheid-Muster-Example.png). If possible, bring *Steuerbescheide* of the last 2-3 years, not just the latest one.
        - [ ] **and net profit determination** (*[[Netto-Gewinnermittlung]]*)  
            You must get this document from a tax advisor. It shows how much profit you have made. It can have different formats. It must be verified and stamped by a tax advisor (*[[Steuerberater]]*).
        - [ ] **and bank statement** (*[[Kontoauszug]]*)  
            Your bank account statement must show that you have a regular source of income. It should also show your health insurance payments and your rent payments. You can request this document from your bank. It does not have a specific format.
        - [ ] **and invoices** (*Abrechnungen*)  
            Bring invoices from your clients or customers. Those show how you make money as a freelancer. Bring all invoices, not just a sample. The invoices must be sorted by date.
        - [ ] **and contracts from your clients**  
            Bring contracts that prove that you will have more work in the future. Contracts are not officially required, but they might ask for them.[^10] If possible, the contracts must describe the kind of work you will do. You can also bring letters of intent (*[[Absichtserklärung]]*) from future clients.
- [ ] **Proof of housing costs**  
    You must show how much you pay every month for your apartment or home. It must also prove that you live in Berlin.
    - **Lease** (*Mietvertrag*), if you rent a room or an apartment. Bring the original lease, not a copy. The lease must show how much rent you pay.
    - or **a proof of ownership**, if you own a house. It must show how much you pay per month.
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance coverage** (*Mitgliedsbescheinigung* or *Nachweis der Krankenversicherung*)
    - [ ] **Proof of health insurance coverage**  
        You can request this from your health insurer. You can usually get it from their website.
    - [ ] **and proof of monthly payments**  
        Bring a document that shows how much you pay for health insurance. For example, bank transactions that show health insurance payments. This is not officially required, but they sometimes ask for it. Your tax advisor might also need it for your *[[Prüfungsbericht]]*.[^11]
- [ ] **Proof of retirement savings**  
    If you are over 45 years old, you must prove that you will get a pension of at least {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_MONTHLY_PENSION|cur}}€ per month for at least 12 years, or that you have {{FREELANCE_VISA_MIN_PENSION|cur}}€ in assets.
    - If you are a citizen of the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Turkey or the United States, you do not need this proof.
    - If you are under 46 years old, you do not need this proof.
- [ ] **Proof of residence in Berlin**  
    You must prove that your main residence is in Berlin.
    - **Registration certificate** ([*Anmeldebestätigung*](/glossary/Anmeldebest%C3%A4tigung))  
        This is the document you receive when you do you register your address (*[[Anmeldung]]*).
    - **or a lease + a landlord confirmation letter** (*Mietvertrag* + *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*)  
        If you don't have a registration certificate, bring your original lease - not a copy - and the landlord confirmation letter instead.
- [ ] **Short description of your business** (optional)  
    Prepare a short document that describes your business, and how you make money. You can use this to explain other documents. [For example](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-explanation.pdf), I described my website and its business model. I included screenshots of the website and graphs of the monthly traffic. I used it to show that my business is growing, and to explain why I do not need contracts for a stable income.

### How to prepare the documents

You must print hundreds of pages. I printed around 350 pages for my appointment.

- **Print everything**  
    During your appointment, you can't show documents on your computer, your tablet or your phone. You can't email missing documents. You must have every document with you, printed.
- **Buy a laser printer**  
    You must print hundreds of pages. I printed around 350 pages for my appointment. You will need extra paper, staples and printer cartridges.
- **Label your documents**  
    During your appointment, you must quickly find the documents they ask for. Use post-its and a highlighter to make your documents easy to find, and easy to read.
- **Do not bind the documents together**  
    They will ask for the documents one by one. They will also take some out to scan them.
- **Sort your invoices**  
    Your invoices must be sorted by date.[^12]
