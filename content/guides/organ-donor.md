## How to register as an organ donor

Germany has no organ donor registry. You must leave a clear proof that you want to donate your organs.

- **[Get an organ donor card](https://www.organspende-info.de/organspendeausweis-download-und-bestellen/)** (*Organspendeausweis*)  
    Order a card online for free, or print your own. Sign it, and carry it with you. Give a copy to someone you trust. This card is the only proof that you want to donate your organs.
- **Inform your family or your next-of-kin**  
    If they don't find your organ donor card, they will ask your next-of-kin. That person must guess if you wanted to give your organs. Tell them exactly what you want while you are alive.

## How organ donations work in Germany

Organ donations are opt-in. They do not take your organs without your consent. There is no organ donor registry; you must leave some proof that you want to donate your organs.

To consent to donate your organs, you must be at least 16 years old. To refuse to donate your organs, you must be at least 14 years old. You can choose to donate all your organs, or only specific organs.

If you die without making a decision, your next-of-kin must guess what you would have wanted.[^0] Make a clear decision and tell other people. It's easier that way.

### Donating organs after you die

Post-mortem donations only happen if...

- **You are dead**  
    Two independent doctors must confirm your brain death. If there is a chance that you could live again, they will not take your organs.
- **and you [consented](#how-to-register-as-an-organ-donor) to give your organs**
- **and your next-of-kin allows it**

After your death, the Eurotransplant Foundation will find someone who needs your organs. After the organ transplant, they will return your body to your family for burial or cremation.[^1]

You do not get paid, but you can save a person's life. In Germany, 9,000 people need an organ transplant.[^2]

### Donating while you are alive

While you are alive, you can donate blood and stem cells. Both procedures are safe for you.
