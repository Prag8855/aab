## Tax software for employees

Tax software for employees help you prepare and send a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). This is how you pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).

English-speaking options:

- [Wundertax](/out/wundertax)
- [Taxfix](/out/taxfix)
- [SteuerGo](/out/steuergo)

You can also file your taxes yourself in [[ELSTER]]. It's free, but it's only in German.

## Tax software for freelancers

Tax software for self-employed people can handle invoicing, bookkeeping, [VAT reporting](/glossary/Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung), payroll and more.

English-speaking options:

- [Accountable](/out/accountable)
- [sevDesk](/out/sevdesk)
- [Sorted](/out/sorted-taxes)

German-speaking options:

- [Lexware Office](/out/lexoffice) (this is what I use)
- [FastBill](/out/fastbill)

Some business banks help you with invoicing, bookkeeping and [VAT reporting](/glossary/Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung). I don't recommend them. You can have a good bank or good tax software, but you can't have both in one product. Keep those services separate.

These banks help with your accounting:

- [Qonto](/out/qonto)
- [Holvi](/out/holvi)
- [Kontist](/out/kontist) (read my [review of Kontist](/guides/kontist-review) first)

## Alternatives to tax software

- [Hire a tax advisor](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin). Use my list of English-speaking tax advisors.
- Join a *[[Lohnsteuerhilfeverein]]*.
- Join a freelancer cooperative like [Smart](/out/smart-coop).
