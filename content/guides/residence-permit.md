## How to get a residence permit

You can apply for a residence permit...[^12]

- **At the German embassy or consulate in your country**  
    Apply for a [[National Visa]], come to Germany, and convert your National Visa to a residence permit at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.
- **At the [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde) in Germany**  
    Come to Germany, and apply for a residence permit at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

Your options depend on your situation:

- **German residents**  
    If you already have a residence permit, you can change or renew it at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* in Germany. You must do this before your current residence permit expires.
- **Privileged countries**  
    If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you can come to Germany without a visa. After you arrive, you have 90 days to apply for a residence permit at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.[^2] You can also apply for it at the German embassy or consulate in your home country.
- **Everyone else**  
    You must apply for a [[National Visa]] - not a [[Schengen visa]] - at the German embassy or consulate in your country. When you get your National Visa, you can move to Germany. After you arrive, you must convert your visa into a residence permit.

It's often better if you apply in your home country. You can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany, so you don't need to wait in Germany without an income.

## How to read the Zusatzblatt

Your residence permit comes with a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. This piece of paper explains the conditions of your residence permit. For example, what kind of work you can do, and which employer you can work for.

This is what those lines mean:

- **Erlischt mit Bezug von Leistungen nach dem SGB II oder SGB XII**

    Self-employment is allowed.[^17] If it's a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], part-time self-employment is allowed, but must keep your job, and your job must be your main source of income.[^10]
