## How to get a residence permit

You can apply for a residence permit...[^12]

- **At the German embassy or consulate in your country**  
    Apply for a [[National Visa]], come to Germany, and convert your National Visa to a residence permit at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.
- **At the [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde) in Germany**  
    Come to Germany, and apply for a residence permit at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

Your options depend on your situation:

- **German residents**  
    If you already have a residence permit, you can change or renew it at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* in Germany. You must do this before your current residence permit expires.
- **Privileged countries**  
    If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you can come to Germany without a visa. After you arrive, you have 90 days to apply for a residence permit at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.[^2] You can also apply for it at the German embassy or consulate in your home country.
- **Everyone else**  
    You must apply for a [[National Visa]] - not a [[Schengen visa]] - at the German embassy or consulate in your country. When you get your National Visa, you can move to Germany. After you arrive, you must convert your visa into a residence permit.

It's often better if you apply in your home country. You can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany, so you don't need to wait in Germany without an income.

**[See other people's feedback ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

### Bring your family to Germany

The [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) lets you bring your family to Germany. If they have a family reunion visa, your family members can work, study, freelance or start a business in Germany.

You can apply for it at the same time as your residence permit.

### Activate your [[eID]]

You can use your residence permit to log into online government services. For example, you can use it to [change your address](/guides/address-change) or apply for [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I). You must activate this feature at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Activate your eID before you need it.**

**[How to activate your eID ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### Make a tax declaration

Your immigration expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep all your receipts and proofs of payment. Include them in your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). You will pay a little less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer). If you hire a lawyer or a relocation consultant, their fee is also tax-deductible.

## How to renew a residence permit

Your residence permit is valid for 6 months to 4 years. When it's about to expire, you must renew it at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. In Berlin, you must renew your residence permit 8 weeks before it expires, not sooner.[^11] It takes [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to renew a residence permit.{{ fail_on('2025-06-01') }}

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will check if you still meet all the requirements of your residence permit. You need a few documents to prove this. Start preparing them in advance.

**[How to renew a Blue Card ➞](/guides/blue-card#renew-your-blue-card)**

**[How to renew a freelance visa ➞](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)**

If you qualify, you can also apply for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or citizenship. This is always a better option.

**[How to apply for permanent residence ➞](/guides/permanent-residence)**

## Travel with a residence permit

Your residence permit lets you travel in the [[Schengen area]] without a visa.

If you travel outside Germany for more than 6 months, your residence permit expires.[^22] The [[Blue Card]] lets you travel for 12 months.

If you have German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you can travel 6 months outside of Germany. If you have [EU permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence), you can travel 12 to 24 months outside the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), or 6 years in another EU country.[^21]

To travel longer, you need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

## How to read the Zusatzblatt

Your residence permit comes with a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. This piece of paper explains the conditions of your residence permit. For example, what kind of work you can do, and which employer you can work for.

[![Zusatzblatt for a residence permit](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png "Zusatzblatt for a freelance visa")](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png)

This is what those lines mean:

- **[Erwerbstätigkeit erlaubt](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png)**  
    All occupations are allowed. You can do any kind of work, including self-employment.[^16]
- **Erlischt mit Bezug von Leistungen nach dem SGB II oder SGB XII**  
    You can't receive *[[Bürgergeld]]*.[^3] You can still receive [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).
- **[Selbständige Tätigkeit gestattet](/images/aufenthaltstitel.jpg)**  
    Self-employment is allowed.[^17] If it's a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], part-time self-employment is allowed, but must keep your job, and your job must be your main source of income.[^10]
