## How to apply in Berlin

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and start preparing your residence permit application.

### 2. Prepare your application

Before you apply for a residence permit, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be big enough. In Berlin, you need 9 m^2^ per adult, and 6 m^2^ per child.[^20]
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your total cost of living must be less than your income.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a residence permit.[^23] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-work-visa-or-blue-card)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance.
- [ ] **Prepare the required documents**  
    Each residence permit has different requirements. Each *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* requires different documents.

While you wait for an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for your registration certificate.[^23]
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#open-a-bank-account)**  
    You will need a bank account for many things. You also need a bank account to pay the application fee. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

**There are more requirements.** Check the instructions for the [Blue Card](/guides/blue-card), [work visa](/guides/work-visa), [freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa) or [permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence).

### 3. Apply online

In Berlin, you must apply online, and wait for the *Ausländerbehörde* to give you an appointment. **This is the only way.** You can't go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment.

If are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you have 90 days to apply.[^2]

If you already live in Germany, you must apply before your current residence permit expires.

There are two ways to apply in Berlin:

- **Use the application form**  
    The Blue Card, the student visa and some other residence permits have their own application form. Use that form to apply.
- or **use the contact form**  
    If there is no application form for your residence permit, [use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send your documents. You might need to combine and compress your documents to make them fit.

### 4. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. It takes [between a few weeks and a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to get a response. They will reply by email and give you an appointment date. The appointment could be months in the future.

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde), but it might not help.

If your current [[National Visa]] or residence permit expires while you wait, don't panic. It stays valid until the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* makes a decision. You don't need to leave Germany.

In most cases, your current [[National Visa]] or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. You might get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]* that allows travel outside of Germany with an expired residence permit.

**[If your visa or residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

**[How the Fiktionsbescheinigung works ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

### 5. Go to your appointment

### 6. Pick up your residence card

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/allTypes.html" %}

**[See other people's feedback ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

### Bring your family to Germany

The [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) lets you bring your family to Germany. If they have a family reunion visa, your family members can work, study, freelance or start a business in Germany.

You can apply for it at the same time as your residence permit.

### Activate your [[eID]]

You can use your residence permit to log into online government services. For example, you can use it to [change your address](/guides/address-change) or apply for [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I). You must activate this feature at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Activate your eID before you need it.**

**[How to activate your eID ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### Make a tax declaration

Your immigration expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep all your receipts and proofs of payment. Include them in your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). You will pay a little less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer). If you hire a lawyer or a relocation consultant, their fee is also tax-deductible.

## How to renew a residence permit

Your residence permit is valid for 6 months to 4 years. The expiration date is written on the card.

When it's about to expire, you must renew it at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. In Berlin, you must renew your residence permit 8 weeks before it expires, not sooner.[^11] It takes [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to renew a residence permit.{{ fail_on('2025-06-01') }}

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will check if you still meet all the requirements of your residence permit. You need a few documents to prove this. Start preparing them in advance.

**[How to renew a Blue Card ➞](/guides/blue-card#renew-your-blue-card)**

**[How to renew a freelance visa ➞](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)**

You might also qualify for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or citizenship. It's better than renewing your residence permit.

**[Permanent residence requirements ➞](/guides/permanent-residence#permanent-residence-requirements)**

**[Citizenship requirements ➞](/guides/permanent-residence#citizenship)**

## Travel with a residence permit

Your residence permit lets you travel in the [[Schengen area]] without a visa.

If you travel outside Germany for more than 6 months, your residence permit expires.[^22] The [[Blue Card]] lets you travel for 12 months.

If you have German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you can travel 6 months outside of Germany. If you have [EU permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence), you can travel 12 to 24 months outside the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), or 6 years in another EU country.[^21]

To travel longer, you need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

## How to read the Zusatzblatt

Your residence permit comes with a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. This piece of paper explains the conditions of your residence permit. For example, what kind of work you can do, and which employer you can work for.

[![Zusatzblatt for a residence permit](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png "Zusatzblatt for a freelance visa")](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png)

This is what those lines mean:

- **"[Erwerbstätigkeit erlaubt](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png)"**  
    All occupations are allowed. You can do any kind of work, including self-employment.[^16]
- **"Erlischt mit Bezug von Leistungen nach dem SGB II oder SGB XII"**  
    You can't receive *[[Bürgergeld]]*.[^3] You can still receive [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).
- **"[Selbständige Tätigkeit gestattet](/images/aufenthaltstitel.jpg)"**  
    Self-employment is allowed.[^17] If it's a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], part-time self-employment is allowed, but must keep your job, and your job must be your main source of income.[^10]

## Need help?

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500 to 2,000€.[^14] Your employer might pay for it, or hire someone to help you.
