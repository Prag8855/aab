## How to apply in Berlin

You can only apply in Berlin if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^15]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or [renew it](#how-to-renew-a-residence-permit)
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa) or an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]] that you must convert to a residence permit.

If you can't apply in Berlin, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

**These instructions are for Berlin only.** The application process is different in every German city.

### 1. Prepare your application

[Come to Berlin](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and start preparing your residence permit application.

Before you apply, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be big enough. In Berlin, you need 9 m^2^ per adult, and 6 m^2^ per child.[^20]
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your total cost of living must be less than your income.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a residence permit.[^23] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance.
- [ ] **Prepare the required documents**  
    The required documents are different at each *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, and for each residence permit. Check the required documents for the [Blue Card](/guides/blue-card#required-documents), [work visa](/guides/work-visa#required-documents), [freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa#required-documents) or [permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence#required-documents).

While you wait for an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for your registration certificate.[^23]
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#open-a-bank-account)**  
    You will need a bank account for many things. You also need a bank account to pay the application fee. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

**There are more requirements.** Check the instructions for the [Blue Card](/guides/blue-card), [work visa](/guides/work-visa), [freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa) or [permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence).

### 2. Apply online

In Berlin, you must apply online, and wait for the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* to give you an appointment. **This is the only way.** You can't go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment.

If are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you have 90 days to apply after you arrive in Germany.[^2]

If you already live in Germany, you must apply before your current residence permit expires.

There are two ways to apply in Berlin:

- **Use the application form**  
    The Blue Card, the student visa and some other residence permits have their own application form. Use that form to apply.
- or **use the contact form**  
    If there is no application form for your residence permit, [use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#send-your-documents-and-wait) to send your documents. You might need to combine and compress your documents to make them fit.

### 3. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. It takes a few weeks to a few months to get a response. They will email you and give you an appointment date. The appointment could be months in the future.

**[Ausländerbehörde wait times ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#sue-the-auslanderbehorde), but it might not help.

If your current [[National Visa]] or residence permit expires while you wait, don't panic. It stays valid until the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* makes a decision. You don't need to leave Germany.

In most cases, your current [[National Visa]] or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) stays valid while you wait. [If it expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon), you don't have to leave Germany. You might get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]* that allows travel outside of Germany with an expired residence permit.

**[If your visa or residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-residence-permit-expires-soon)**

**[How the Fiktionsbescheinigung works ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

### 4. Go to your appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment. Follow the instructions in the email. They might ask you to bring more documents.

Go to the correct *Ausländerbehörde*. There are [two locations in Berlin](/guides/immigration-office#locations).

When you go to your appointment, bring...

- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**, printed  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You can have it on your phone or print it.[^28]
- [ ] **[Passport photo](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^37]
    - [ ] **Passport of your spouse, parent or child** (if applicable)  
        If you apply for family reunion visas, bring everyone's passports.
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the application fee. You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your residence permit. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **Your family**  
    If you apply for family reunion visas, or for residence permanent residence for a spouse, your family must come with you.[^38]
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend. It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter). [Relocation consultants](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) and [immigration lawyers](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can also translate for you.
- [ ] **Other required documents**  
    In your appointment invitation, the *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for more documents.

The appointment takes 15 to 30 minutes. You sit in a waiting room and wait for your number to be called on the screen. You go to the right office, meet your case worker, give your documents, and answer a few questions.

If they approve your residence permit, you must [pay the application fee](/guides/immigration-office#payment-methods).

Then, they will print your plastic residence card. This takes [around 8 weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). You will get a second appointment to pick up the card. They do not mail the card to you.

You might get a [temporary document](/images/temporary-freelance-visa.jpg) that confirms that your residence was approved. It allows you to start working or studying, but it's not a valid travel document. You can't leave and re-enter Germany with that document.

You might also get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. This document allows you to travel outside of Germany with an expired residence permit. You might need to ask for it. If you already have a *Fiktionsbescheinigung*, they might extend it until your second appointment date.

### 5. Pick up your residence card

Go to your second *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment. Bring your passport and your old residence permit. You will get a plastic residence card and a paper *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*.

During your appointment...

- [ ] Check if the information on your card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.
- [ ] [Read your *Zusatzblatt*.](/guides/zusatzblatt) It describes the conditions of your residence permit. If you lived in Germany for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It allows you to work for any employer and to be self-employed.

You will also get a letter in the mail. It's the activation code for your [[eID]]. You need it to activate the eID function of your residence card. This lets you use your residence permit to log into online government services.

**[How to activate your eID ➞](#activate-your-eid)**

### 1. Get your education recognised

**To apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]]**, you need a university or vocational training. Your education must be recognised in Germany. It must be equivalent to 2 years of training in Germany.[^31]

You must get your training recognised *before* you apply for your National Visa. The process depends on your profession.[^32] It takes a few weeks to a few months.[^33] There might be an interview or a competence test, and you might need to pay for it.[^34]

**[How to get your education recognised ➞](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)**

If you are a citizen of {{ BESCHV_26_COUNTRIES }}, you don't need a degree or vocational training. Skip this step.

If you studied in Germany, your education is already recognised. Skip this step.

If you use the fast track procedure (*Beschleunigtes Verfahren*), skip this step. You submit all your documents at once, and the embassy or consulate takes care of it.[^35]

### 2. Get an appointment at the German embassy or consulate

Get an appointment at the German embassy or consulate in your country. It can take months to get an appointment.[^3]

In some countries, you can apply for a [[National Visa]] online, so you don't need an appointment.

**[Find your German embassy or consulate ➞](/out/consulate-finder)**

### 3. Prepare for your appointment

Before your embassy or consulate appointment, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) in Germany**  
    Some embassies and consulates ask for it.[^16] It's really hard to find an apartment before you arrive in Germany.

- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-national-visa)**

- [ ] **Save money**

If you apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], you must...

- [ ] **[Find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

After you arrive in Germany, [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), [get a tax ID](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id) and [open a bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany). Your National Visa allows you to [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#step-6-start-working) or [start your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) as soon as you arrive.[^30]

If you travel outside Germany for more than 6 months, your residence permit expires.[^22] The [[Blue Card]] lets you travel for 12 months.

If you have German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you can travel 6 months outside of Germany. If you have [EU permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence), you can travel 12 to 24 months outside the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), or 6 years in another EU country.[^21]

To travel longer, you need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

## Need help?
