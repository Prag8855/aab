- **At the [[Ausländerbehörde]] in Germany**  
    If you apply in Germany, you get a residence permit. [It takes a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). During that time, you can't work or study, so you must have enough savings to survive. You can only apply in Germany if...
    - You are a citizen of of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^2]

You must do this before your visa expires.[^9] In some cases, you can [apply for a National Visa online](https://digital.diplo.de/visa).

It's better if you apply in your home country. You can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany. It's better than living in Germany for a few months without any income.
