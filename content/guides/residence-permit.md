## How to apply in Germany

You can only apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^15]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or [renew it](#how-to-renew-a-residence-permit)
- **or** you have an [EU Permanent Residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence) in another country
- **or** you have an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]] that you must convert to a residence permit.

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

The instructions below are for Berlin only. Other immigration offices have different rules and wait times. If you don't live in Berlin, [find your local immigration office](https://bamf-navi.bamf.de/de/Themen/Behoerden/) and apply there.

### 1. Prepare your application

[Come to Berlin](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and start preparing your residence permit application.

Before you apply, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be big enough. In Berlin, you need 9 m^2^ per adult, and 6 m^2^ per child.[^20]
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your total cost of living must be less than your income.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a residence permit.[^23]
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance.
- [ ] **Prepare the required documents**  
    The required documents are different at each *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, and for each residence permit. Check the required documents for the [Blue Card](/guides/blue-card#required-documents), [work visa](/guides/work-visa#required-documents), [freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa#required-documents) or [permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence#required-documents).

While you wait for an *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for your registration certificate.[^23]
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany#open-a-bank-account)**  
    You will need a bank account for many things. You also need a bank account to pay the application fee. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

**There might be more requirements.** Check the requirements for the [Blue Card](/guides/blue-card), [work visa](/guides/work-visa), [freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa) or [permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence).

### 2. Send your application

Submit your application to the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. They will check your documents and invite your for an appointment. This is the only way. You can't go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment.

There are 3 ways to apply:

- **Use the [Business Immigration Service](https://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/our-services/bis-business-immigration-service)**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    If you are a skilled worker, use BIS. It's faster, and it's free.[^47]
- or **[use the application form](/guides/immigration-office#apply-for-a-residence-permit)**  
    [Some residence permits](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/en/services/our-services/artikel.878424.en.php) have their own application form. Use that form to apply.
- or **[use the contact form](/guides/immigration-office#use-the-contact-form)**  
    If there is no application form for your residence permit, use the general contact form.

If are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}, you have 90 days to apply after you arrive in Germany.[^2]

If you already live in Germany, apply before your current visa or residence permit expires.[^44] Apply 8 weeks before it expires, not sooner.[^26]

### 3. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. There is no way to track your application. They [weeks or months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to reply, but they approve 99% of applications.[^41] If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/immigration-office#sue-the-auslanderbehorde), but it might not help.

They might ask for more documents. If you can't reply to their email, [use the contact form](/guides/immigration-office#use-the-contact-form) again.

When they have everything, they will email you an appointment date. The appointment might be months later. If they can't reach you, they will post the information [here](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/service/oeffentliche-zustellungen/).

While you wait, your current [[National Visa]] or residence permit might expire. It's usually extended until the *Ausländerbehörde* processes your case.

**[If your visa or residence permit expires ➞](#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires)**

### 4. Go to your appointment

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you an appointment date. If you get an appointment, you are almost guaranteed to get your residence permit.[^56]

When you go to your appointment, bring...

- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**  
    You can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde* without it. They check at the door. You can have it on your phone or print it.[^28]
- [ ] **[Passport photo](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^37]
    - [ ] **Passport of your spouse, parent or child** (if applicable)  
        If you apply for family reunion visas, bring everyone's passports.
- [ ] **Cash, Visa, Mastercard or [[Girocard]]**  
    You must pay the application fee. You must sometimes pay later, when you pick up your residence permit. This fee is [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep the receipt.
- [ ] **Other required documents**  
    Read the email carefully. The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask you to bring more documents.
- [ ] **Your family**  
    If you apply for family reunion visas, or for residence permanent residence for a spouse, your family must come with you.[^38]
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend. It's not required, but it helps. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter).

Go to the [correct *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/immigration-office#locations). Arrive early. You need enough time to find the correct waiting room. If you are late, they might refuse to help you.[^53]

Inside the *Ausländerbehörde*, find the right office, floor and room. This information is on your appointment confirmation. The security staff can help you.

[![Berlin Ausländerbehörde appointment room](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)

Sit in the correct waiting room. Wait until the television shows your number. Go to the office number (*Platz*) you see on the television. The appointment takes a few minutes. You must give your documents and answer a few questions.

If documents are missing, ask if you can email them. You will pay the fee and give your fingerprints, so you don't need another *Ausländerbehörde* visit.[^55]

If they approve your residence permit, you must [pay the application fee](/guides/immigration-office#payment-methods) at the payment machines.

They must print your plastic residence card. This takes [around 8 weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). They will give you another appointment to pick up the card. They do not mail the card to you.

You might get a document that confirms that your residence was approved. With that document, **you can start working or studying**.[^45] It's not a valid travel document, so you can't use it to leave and re-enter Germany.

Ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It allows you to travel with an expired residence permit. If you already have a *Fiktionsbescheinigung*, they might extend it until your second appointment date.

### 5. Pick up your residence card

Go to your second *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment. Bring your passport and your old residence permit. You will get a plastic residence card and a paper *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*.

If you pick up a residence permit for a child, they don't need to come with you.[^54]

Check if the information on your card is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

You will also get a letter in the mail. It's the activation code for your [[eID]]. You need it to activate the eID function of your residence card. This lets you use your residence permit to log into online government services.

**[How to activate your eID ➞](#activate-your-eid)**

## How to apply in your country

You can apply in your country before you move to Germany.[^42] This is **cheaper and safer**, because you can start working or studying as soon as you arrive in Germany. You don't need to wait in Germany without an income.[^29]

For most people, this is the only option.

To apply in your country:[^27]

1. If your residence permit requires a job offer, find a job first. If you don't have a job offer, get an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte).
2. Prepare your [[National Visa]] application.
3. Get an appointment at the German embassy or consulate in your country. At some embassies, you can apply online, so you don't need an appointment.
4. Go to your appointment.
5. Receive your National Visa.
6. Come to Germany and start working or studying.
7. Convert your National Visa into a residence permit.

**To get a residence permit faster**, use the [fast-track procedure](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/looking-for-foreign-professionals/entering/the-fast-track-procedure-for-skilled-workers) (*Beschleunigtes Verfahren*). It costs {{FAST_TRACK_FEE|cur}}€.[^39] In India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and many African countries, it takes months to get an embassy appointment. The fast-track procedure really helps, especially if you bring your family with you.[^40]

### 1. Find a job

**If you apply for a [[Blue Card]]**, you need a job offer *before* you apply. Your job offer must meet the [Blue Card requirements](/guides/blue-card#blue-card-requirements).

**If you apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa)**, you need a job offer *before* you apply. Your job offer must meet the [work visa requirements](/guides/work-visa#work-visa-requirements).

**If you don't have a job offer**, get an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte). It allows you to come to Germany and look for work. If your spouse is a German resident, you can get a [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) instead.

**[How to find a job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

### 2. Get your education recognised

**If you apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa), [[Blue Card]] or [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)**, you might need a recognised university degree or vocational training. You must get your education recognised.

**[Blue Card requirements ➞](/guides/blue-card#blue-card-requirements)**

**[Work visa requirements ➞](/guides/work-visa#work-visa-requirements)**

The process depends on your profession.[^32] It takes a few weeks to a few months.[^33] There might be an interview or a competence test, and you might need to pay for it.[^34] You can do this in advance, or after you get your job offer.

**[How to get your education recognised ➞](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)**

If you use the [fast-track procedure](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/looking-for-foreign-professionals/entering/the-fast-track-procedure-for-skilled-workers) (*Beschleunigtes Verfahren*), skip this step. You submit all your documents at once, and the embassy or consulate takes care of it.[^35]

If you are a citizen of {{ BESCHV_26_COUNTRIES }}, you don't need a degree or vocational training. Skip this step.

If you have a lot of work experience, you might not need a degree or vocational training. See the [work visa](/guides/work-visa#work-visa-requirements) and [Blue Card](/guides/blue-card#blue-card-requirements) requirements.

If you graduated in Germany, your education is already recognised. Skip this step.

### 3. Get an appointment at the German embassy or consulate

Get an appointment at the German embassy or consulate in your country. It can take a long time to get an appointment.[^3] At most embassies, you can only book an appointment a few weeks in advance.

In some countries, you can apply for a [[National Visa]] online, so you don't need an appointment. They process your application, then send you a link to book an appointment.

**[Find your German embassy or consulate ➞](/out/consulate-finder)**

**Do not apply for a [[Schengen visa]].** Schengen visas are for tourism, not immigration. You can't convert a Schengen visa into a residence permit.[^9]

### 4. Prepare for your appointment

Before your embassy or consulate appointment, you must...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) in Germany**  
    Some embassies and consulates ask for it.[^16] It's really hard to find an apartment before you arrive in Germany. Find a temporary place like a hotel room or a furnished apartment to get your National Visa.[^17] After you arrive in Germany, find an apartment where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung).
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-national-visa)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance.
- [ ] **Prepare the required documents**  
    The required documents are different in each country. [Find your German embassy or consulate](/out/consulate-finder), and use their list of required documents.
- [ ] **Save money**  
    If you apply at the embassy or consulate, they might need proof that you have savings in your bank account. Each place has different requirements. They usually ask for around 10,000€ in savings.[^24]

If you apply for a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], you must...

- [ ] **[Find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**  
    You need a job offer to apply for a work visa or a Blue Card.
- [ ] **[Get your education recognised ➞](#get-your-education-recognised)**

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. Prepare these documents too.

### 5. Go to your National Visa appointment

Go to your appointment at the embassy or consulate, and give your documents. If you have all the required documents, it only takes a few minutes.

### 6. Receive your National Visa

In a few months, you must go to the embassy or consulate again.[^25] They will give you a [[National Visa]]. It allows you to [come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin).

### 7. Move to Germany

After you arrive in Germany, [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), [get a tax ID](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id) and [open a bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany). Your National Visa allows you to [start working](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working) or [start your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) as soon as you arrive.[^30]

**[How to move to Berlin ➞](/guides/moving-to-berlin)**

**[How to start a new job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working)**

**[How to start a business ➞](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany)**

### 8. Convert your National Visa

Your National Visa is only valid for up to 12 months.[^36] Before it expires, you must convert it into a residence permit at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

In Berlin, you must convert your National Visa **8 weeks before it expires**, not sooner.[^26]

If you will leave Germany before your National Visa expires, you don't need to convert it.[^31] For example, if you have a 12 month [[National Visa]] for a 9 month internship, you don't need to convert it into a residence permit.

To convert your National Visa into a residence permit:

1. **[Contact the Ausländerbehörde](/guides/immigration-office#how-to-contact-the-auslanderbehorde)**  
    Write to the *Ausländerbehörde* around 8 weeks before your National Visa expires. They take a really long time to reply. When they reply, they will give you an appointment. [If your National Visa expires](#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires), you can stay in Germany and keep working or studying.
2. **Go to your appointment**  
    During the appointment, they take your fingerprints for your freelance visa. It takes around 15 minutes. You get a second appointment [around 8 weeks later](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to pick up your residence permit.
3. **Pick up your residence permit**  
    Go to your second *Ausländerbehörde* appointment to collect your residence permit. Bring your passport and your old residence permit.

## After you get your permit

### Give feedback

Tell me how long it took to get your residence permit. Your feedback helps thousands of people plan their application.

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/allTypes.html" %}

**[See other people's feedback ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

### Read your Zusatzblatt

Your residence permit comes with a *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. It describes the conditions of your residence permit. It tells you what kind of work you can do.

**[How to read your Zusatzblatt ➞](/guides/zusatzblatt)**

### Bring your family to Germany

The [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) allows you to bring your family to Germany. If they have a family reunion visa, your family members can work, study, freelance or start a business in Germany.

You can apply for it at the same time as your residence permit.

### Activate your [[eID]]

You can use your residence permit to log into online government services. For example, you can use it to [change your address](/guides/address-change) or apply for [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I). You must activate this feature at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. **Activate your eID before you need it.**

**[How to activate your eID ➞](/guides/eid-online-ausweisfunktion)**

### Make a tax declaration

Your immigration expenses are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so keep all your receipts and proofs of payment. Include them in your [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung). You will pay a little less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer). If you hire a lawyer or a relocation consultant, their fee is also tax-deductible.

## How to renew a residence permit

Your residence permit is valid for 6 months to 4 years. The expiration date is written on the card.

When it's about to expire, you must renew it at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. In Berlin, you must renew your residence permit 8 weeks before it expires, not sooner.[^11] It takes [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) to renew a residence permit.{{ fail_on('2025-06-01') }}

The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will check if you still meet all the requirements of your residence permit. You need a few documents to prove this. Start preparing them in advance.

**[How to renew a Blue Card ➞](/guides/blue-card#renew-your-blue-card)**

**[How to renew a freelance visa ➞](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)**

You might also qualify for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or citizenship. It's better than a residence permit.

**[Permanent residence requirements ➞](/guides/permanent-residence#permanent-residence-requirements)**

**[Citizenship requirements ➞](/guides/permanent-residence#citizenship)**

## If you change or lose your job

When you change jobs, [tell the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/losing-your-job#tell-the-auslanderbehorde). You might need their permission to work for a different employer.

If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), your residence permit stays valid. [Tell the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/losing-your-job#tell-the-auslanderbehorde) as soon as you can. In Berlin, they give you 6 months to find another job. While you are unemployed, you can usually get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).

**[What happens to your residence permit ➞](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-residence-permit)**

## If you travel

Your residence permit allows you to travel in the [[Schengen area]] without a visa.

If you travel outside Germany for more than 6 months, your residence permit expires.[^22] The [[Blue Card]] lets you travel for 12 months.

If you have German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you can travel 6 months outside of Germany. If you have the [EU permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence), you can travel 12 to 24 months outside the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), or 6 years in another EU country.[^21]

To travel longer, you need permission from the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.

## If your visa or residence permit expires

Your [[National Visa]] or residence permit expires after 6 to 48 months. You must renew it at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. The process is almost the same as when you apply for a new residence permit.

It can take [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). While you wait, **you can usually stay in Germany**, even if your visa or residence permit expires.[^43]

### If you have a [[National Visa]] or a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)

You can stay in Germany after it expires if...

- [ ] You have applied to renew or change your residence permit
- [ ] and you sent a complete application before your visa or residence permit expired[^52]
- [ ] and you are waiting for the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*

**You can keep working or studying** while you wait. The conditions of your *current* National Visa or residence permit still apply. Some employers don't know that. [Check your *Zusatzblatt*](/guides/zusatzblatt) to know what you are allowed to do.

**You should not leave Germany.** You might be unable to re-enter Germany with your expired residence permit or National Visa. Citizens of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}} [can usually travel](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-without-a-fiktionsbescheinigung). Others need a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*.

**[Travel with an expired residence permit ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung#travel-with-a-fiktionsbescheinigung)**

### Everyone else

**If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**, you can stay 90 days in Germany without a visa.[^50] If you apply for a residence permit, you can stay in Germany until the *Ausländerbehörde* processes your application. You must apply within 90 days of entering Germany.[^51]

While you wait for your first residence permit, you can't work or study.

**If you have a [[Schengen visa]]**, you must leave Germany before it expires. Schengen visas are for tourism, not immigration. You can rarely extend it. You can rarely convert it into a residence permit.[^48] You can't get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*.

### Travel with an expired residence permit

**[How the Fiktionsbescheinigung works ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

## Need help?

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500 to 2,000€.[^14] Your employer might pay for it, or hire someone to help you. Some organisations can also help you for free.
