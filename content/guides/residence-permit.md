## Who needs a German residence permit?

Most people need a residence permit to live in Germany for more than 3 months.

It depends on your citizenship:

- **European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway**  
    You don't need a residence permit. You can already live, work and study in Germany.[^0] If you work in Germany, you still need to [register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer), and get [German health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance).
- **Switzerland**  
    You need a residence permit. It's easier to get.[^1] [More information here](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/324287/en/).
- **{{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**[^2]  
    You need a residence permit to work, study, or freelance in Germany. You can visit in Germany for up to 90 days without a visa.[^3] You can apply for a residence permit in Germany, or in your home country.
- **Any other country**  
    You need a residence permit to work, study, or freelance in Germany. You need a [job seeker visa](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/types/jobseekers) look for work in Germany.[^3] You might need a [[Schengen visa]] to visit Germany as a tourist. You can't convert a tourist visa to a residence permit.[^4]

**If you are a German [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis)**, you can already live and work in Germany. You do not need another residence permit.

**If you want to visit Germany as a tourist**, you don't need a residence permit. You might need a [[Schengen visa]]. Use [this list](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/-/231148) to know if you need a Schengen visa to visit Germany.

These residence permits sometimes allow you to freelance:

- **[Work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]]**  
    Look on your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and on the *[Zusatzblatt](/glossary/Zusatzblatt%20%28residence%20permit%29)*. If it says [*Selbständige Tätigkeit gestattet*](/images/aufenthaltstitel.jpg) or [*Erwerbstätigkeit erlaubt*](/images/aufenthaltstitel-zusatzblat-back-web.png), you can be self-employed *in addition* to your job. You must keep your job, and it must be your main source of income.
- **[[Student visa]]**  
    By default, the student visa does not allow self-employment. You must ask the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* first. They will update your student visa, and let you study and run a business at the same time. - [More information](/guides/how-to-get-a-german-freelance-visa#for-students)

## How to get a residence permit

You can apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) in your home country, or in Germany.

- **At the [[Ausländerbehörde]] in Germany**  
    If you apply in Germany, you get a residence permit. Usually, it takes 2 to 3 months to get the residence permit.[^8] During that time, you can't work or study, so you must have enough savings to survive. You can only apply in Germany if...
    - You are a citizen of of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^2]
    - **or** you already have a German residence permit, and you want to renew or change it.
- **At the German embassy or consulate in your country**  
    If you apply in your country, you get a [[National Visa]]. As soon as you get the visa, you can move to Germany and start working or studying. When you arrive in Germany, you must convert your National Visa to a residence at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. You must do this before your visa expires (in 3 to 12 months).[^9]

It's better if you apply in your home country. You can start working as soon as you arrive in Germany, instead of living in Germany without any income.

**[How to apply for a freelance visa ➞](/guides/how-to-get-a-german-freelance-visa)**

### Renewing your residence permit

Your residence permit expires in 6 months to 4 years. You must go to the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* to renew it. They will check if you still meet all the conditions of your residence permit. Some residence permits ([like the freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)) are really annoying to renew, because you need a lot of documents.

**[How to renew a freelance visa ➞](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa)**

After a few years, you can apply for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis). You don't need to renew your permanent residence. It lets you do anything you want: work, study, freelance, etc.
