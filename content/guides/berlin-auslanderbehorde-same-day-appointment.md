If you need to apply for a residence permit or renew a German visa, you must go to the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. There are two ways to go to the *Ausländerbehörde* in Berlin:

- **With an appointment**  
    Get an appointment online, then go to your appointment. It's often impossible to get an appointment in time. You must check Berlin.de again and again. Appointments are only released for the next 3 months. New appointments are released every day.
- **Without an appointment**  
    At the moment, you can't go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment. You can't queue in front of the *Ausländerbehörde* early in the morning. If you can't get an appointment, try [applying by email](#by-email).

## Is it hard to get an appointment?

**Yes, it's very hard.** Look for an appointment as soon as possible. It can take weeks just to find an appointment.[^0] If you apply by email, it can take months to get an answer. If this is your first [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), you can't work, freelance or study while you wait for the residence permit.

## How to get an appointment

You can use the [appointment booking tool](/out/auslanderbehorde-appointment), or [email the *Ausländerbehörde*](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/ueber-uns/aktuelles/artikel.1041742.php#english). **You can't go to the Berlin Ausländerbehörde without an appointment.**

### Online

**Most of the time, there are no appointments available**. This is not a bug. Keep the calendar page open, and refresh it every 5-10 minutes. If you wait too long, you must re-enter your information every time. New appointments become available at random times. They also release short-term appointments every Wednesday and Friday.[^1]

Sometimes, the website crashes. Wait a few minutes and try again.

### By email

**If you can't get an online appointment,** [email your residence permit application to the *Ausländerbehörde*](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/ueber-uns/kontakt/).[^2]

Attach all your application documents.[^3] A complete application might be processed faster. If you need a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, say it in your message.[^23]

The Ausländerbehörde will process your application. You won't get any answer for a few months.[^4] It looks like they work on the most urgent cases first.

If your residence permit expires while you wait, the conditions of your residence permit still apply. You can keep working, freelancing or studying like before.[^5] You should not travel outside of Germany, because you can't re-enter the country with an expired residence permit.

### By registered mail

You can send your residence permit application by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief). It's exactly like if you apply by email. It's not better or faster.[^23]

### In person

Do not go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment. You will not get help. You can't queue early in the morning, and get what you want.

Follow [this Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/226825394858771/posts/887004532174184/) to know about the current situation at the *Ausländerbehörde*.

## What happens during your appointment

### Entering the Ausländerbehörde

You should have received the details of your appointment by email when you booked it. Arrive in advance. You need time to find the right office, floor and room. You can find these details in your appointment confirmation.

At the *Ausländerbehörde*, sit in the waiting room and wait until your number is called. The numbers are called on the television. When your number is called, you must go to the office number you see on the television.

[![Auslaenderbehoerde appointment room](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-appointment-room.jpg)

### Your residence permit interview

You will sit in front of an *Ausländerbehörde* employee and show your documents. This takes around 10 minutes.[^6] The employee will tell you to go in the waiting room again. They will call your number again in 5 to 45 minutes.

Some *Ausländerbehörde* employees speak English, but many only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring a translator with you. [Red Tape Translation](https://www.redtapetranslation.com/) and [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) can go to the *Ausländerbehörde* with you. You can also [bring an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin).

**If your current residence permit expires soon**, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. It lets you stay in Germany for a little longer. Some versions of the *Fiktionsbescheinigung* let you travel outside of Germany.

**[How the Fiktionsbescheinigung works ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

Some residence permits are approved on the same day, during your interview. You get a paper residence permit, pay the fee, and leave. Around 8 weeks later, you get your plastic residence permit by mail.

Most residence permits are approved 1 to 6 months later.[^7]

### If your application is approved

1 to 6 months after your application,[^7] you will get a letter with the PIN and PUK for your plastic residence permit (*elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel* or *eAT*). You don't need to do anything yet. A few weeks later, you will get your residence permit by post.

Your residence permit is valid between 6 months and 4 years. It depends on what residence permit you get, and how good your application is. Freelancers can get a shorter freelance visa if their income is low or if their health insurance is not good enough. When your residence permit is about to expire, you can renew it. The process is very similar.

If you had a German residence permit for over 3 years, you might get an unrestricted residence permit. It lets you do any type of work you want. For example, you could get a full time job, study or even open a restaurant.

Your residence permit is a plastic card, not a sticker in your passport. Your address is written on the card. If you move to another address, they will update your residence permit during the *[[Anmeldung]]*. They just put a sticker with your new address on your residence permit.

### If your application is rejected

If some documents are missing, they will give you a new appointment in a few days. This gives you time to get the missing documents and apply again.

If your current visa expires soon, you might get a temporary visa (*[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*). It lets you stay in Germany a little longer. It gives you time to apply again.

If you get a rejection letter later, it will ask for more information, or tell you why your application was rejected. You still have a month to respond or appeal. If this happens, you should probably [hire an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) to help you.

If you don't get a residence permit, you pay nothing.

### If you don't get an answer

If you apply, and you don't get an answer after 3 months, you can sue the *Ausländerbehörde*[^9]. This is called an *Untätigkeitsklage nach § 75 VwGO*. Usually, it makes them move faster. Immigration lawyers can help you do this.

If the *Ausländerbehörde* can't reach you, they will post the information [here](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/service/oeffentliche-zustellungen/).

### How to pay the residence permit fee

When your residence permit is approved, you must pay a fee. You only pay the fee if you get a residence permit is approved. If your application is rejected, you pay nothing.

 They will give you a plastic [payment card](/images/auslanderbehoerde-kassenkarte.jpg) (*Kassenkarte*). Bring that card to a [payment machine](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg) (*Kassenautomat*). Follow [the signs](/images/auslanderbehoerde-signs.jpg) to find the payment machines. These machines accept cash, EC cards, Visa and Mastercard.[^10] If your card is not accepted, you can also get cash from [this nearby ATM](https://goo.gl/maps/8cBy48WnTfbya13r6), even at night.

![Auslaenderbehoerde kassenautomat](/images/auslaenderbehoerde-kassenautomat.jpg)

After you pay, you can go home. Keep your receipt; residence permit fees are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar).

## If your visa expires soon

In some cases, you can stay in Germany after your visa or residence permit expires.

After your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, the interviewer can give you a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. This temporary visa lets you stay in Germany while you wait for your new residence permit. If you forgot some documents, the *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]* gives you more time to reapply.

### If you have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)

**If you have an Ausländerbehörde appointment**, you can stay in Germany until your appointment date, even if your residence permit expires.[^20] You can continue working, freelancing or studying until your appointment date.[^11] You must book the appointment while your residence permit is valid.[^21]

During your appointment, ask for a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*. This will let you travel outside of Germany, even if your residence permit expires.

**[Information about the Fiktionsbescheinigung ➞](/guides/fiktionsbescheinigung)**

**If you [apply by email](#by-email)**, the automated response counts as an application.[^12] You can stay in Germany until they process your application.[^5] You can continue to work, freelance or study while you wait.[^22] You must email your documents before your residence permit expires.[^13]

If your residence permit expires and you don't have a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]*, don't leave Germany. You can't re-enter Germany with an expired residence permit.[^14]

### If you don't have a residence permit

**If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**,[^15] you can stay in Germany for 90 days without a visa. If you have an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment or if you applied by email, you can stay in Germany until your appointment.[^20] You can't work, study or freelance while you wait for your residence permit.

**You can rarely convert a [[Schengen visa]] to a residence permit**.[^16] You can't come to Germany on a tourist visa, then apply for a work visa, Blue Card or freelance visa.[^17] If you want a German residence permit, you must apply in your own country.

**You can rarely extend a Schengen visa**.[^18] An *Ausländerbehörde* appointment does not extend your Schengen visa.[^19] You must leave Germany before your Schengen visa expires. You won't get a *[[Fiktionsbescheinigung]]* if you are on a Schengen visa.

## Questions and answers

### Do they speak English at the Ausländerbehörde?

**Sometimes, but not always**. You should bring an interpreter with you. [Red Tape Translation](https://www.redtapetranslation.com/) and [Booka Local](/out/booka-local) can go to the *Ausländerbehörde* with you. You can also [bring an immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin).

### How can I contact the Ausländerbehörde?

The *Ausländerbehörde* is hard to contact. They rarely answer the phone, and they can take months to answer emails. You must contact the department that is responsible for your nationality or residence permit type. Use [this list](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/ueber-uns/kontakt/).

You can also [get help from other places](/guides/questions-about-berlin#immigration-questions). This is often much faster.

### Which Ausländerbehörde should I go to?

**It depends** on what you need to do, and on your nationality. There are two *Ausländerbehörde* locations. There are two *Ausländerbehörde* locations: [Keplerstraße](https://service.berlin.de/standort/327437/en/) and [Friedrich-Krause-Ufer](https://service.berlin.de/standort/121885/en/). Each *Ausländerbehörde* offers different services for different nationalities. You must go to the correct one.
