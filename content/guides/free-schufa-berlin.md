After you [find an apartment you love](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), you must apply for it. When you apply, you usually include a *[Schufa Bonitätsauskunft](/glossary/Schufa)*. This document shows your Schufa score. It's a bit like a credit score. A good Schufa score shows that you can pay your rent on time every month.

## Do you have a Schufa record?

You get a Schufa record when you [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany) or a cellphone contract for the first time.[^0]

If just moved to Germany, you might not have a Schufa record. There is no information about you. Just tell the landlord that you just moved to Germany. Most landlords will understand.

## Do you need a Schufa?

Most landlords ask for a Schufa when you apply for an apartment.

Most furnished apartments (from [Homelike](/out/homelike), [Spotahome](/out/spotahome), [Wunderflats](/out/wunderflats)) do not ask for a Schufa. It can be a good way to find your first apartment, even if you don't have a job or you are in your [probation period](/glossary/Probezeit). These furnished apartments are much more expensive.

## How to get a Schufa for free

You have [the right](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-15-right-of-access-by-the-data-subject-GDPR.htm) to see the data Schufa Holding AG has about you. This is why you can request a free Schufa report. It looks different from the 30€ report, but it has the same information.[^2] This free Schufa report has all the information your landlord needs.[^1]

This is how you get a free Schufa:

1. On [this page](https://www.meineschufa.de/de/datenkopie), request a *SCHUFA-Datenkopie*.
2. Enter your information and submit the form. You can include scans of your passport and a *[[Meldebescheinigung]]*, but it's not required.

You will get your Schufa *Datenkopie* by mail a few days later. You can only get it by mail, not by email.

## How to get a Schufa quickly

If you need a Schufa *now*, you can get one from a bank, or from ImmobilienScout24's Schufa service. This is not free.

### At the bank

Postbank and Volksbank branches will print your Schufa report, even if you are not a customer. This costs €29.95. Use the [branch locator](https://www.meineschufa.de/index.php?site=14_3) on meinschufa.de to find where to do it. **This is the fastest way to get a Schufa**.

**This service does not work for everyone**. You must verify your identity with your bank. Not all banks can do this. If your bank is not supported, you must send a verification document by mail and wait a few days. You can ask for a refund on their [live chat](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/kontakt.html).
