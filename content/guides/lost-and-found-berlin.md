## Rewards for finding something

If you find something in Germany, you have the right to ask for a reward.[^1] The reward depends on how much the item is worth.

- **Under 500€**: 5% of the value of the item
- **Over 500€**: 25€ + 3% of the value of the item over 500€. For example, for a 1,200€ item: 25€ + 3% of 700€ = 46€
- **Animals**: 3% of the value of the animal

For objects found in the train or public transit, the rules are different:

- **Under 50€**: no reward
- **Over 50€**: half of the normal reward
