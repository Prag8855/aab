## Official font for Berlin

**[Berlin Type](https://www.hvdfonts.com/custom-cases/berlin-type)** is the official font of Berlin since 2021. It's free to use.

## BVG font

The BVG uses the **[FF Transit](https://www.fontshop.com/families/ff-transit)** font for all its signage and advertising. This font and its pictograms were designed by Berlin-based design firm [MetaDesign](https://metadesign.com/) in 1997. FF Transit was designed for signage, and is also used by the Düsseldorf airport and the [Société de transport de Montréal](https://www.stm.info/en/press/press-releases/2015/the-stm-rolls-out-new-signage-in-metro-stations).

## Deutsche Bahn fonts

The [[Deutsche Bahn]] uses **DB Type** for signage. Train markings use **DIN 1451-4** since the 1920s. It replaced **Musterzeichnung IV 44**[^1]).

In the former East Germany, you still see signs in **Erbar Grotesk**. **Helvetica** was also [briefly used](http://www.ralf-bueker.de/Bahnhofs_o._Stationsschilder_Epoche_V_weisse_Grundflaeche,_blau_umrandet,_Namen_in_schwarzer_Schrift.htm).

## German road sign font

German road signs use **DIN 1451** since 1931. It's available in 3 variants: narrow (*Engschrift*), normal (*Mittelschrift*) and wide (*Breitschrift*).

The Deutsche Post also uses DIN 1451.

## German licence plate font

German licence plates use **FE-Schrift** (*Fälschungserschwerende Schrift*)since 1995.[^2] It makes licence plates harder to alter.

## Berlin and East German fonts

A large number of East German signs were made by [DEWAG](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Werbe-_und_Anzeigengesellschaft). They often used variants of the **Erbar Grotesk** font. Erbar is used for Berlin's street name signs, and many warning signs.

There are several digital releases of Erbar: [URW Erbar](https://www.fonts.com/de/font/urw-type-foundry/erbar), [Dunbar](https://cjtype.com/dunbar/), and Peter Wiegel's [Osterbar](http://www.peter-wiegel.de/Osterbar.html).

## "The German font"

When people talk about "the German font", they often think about Fraktur fonts. Use such fonts cautiously; they are old-fashioned, and sometimes associated with National Socialism.

**Tannenberg** was commonly used from 1935 to 1941, then the Nazis banned them in favour of modern typefaces.[^0]
