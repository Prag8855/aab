When you are unemployed, you get unemployment benefits (*[[ALG I]]*). *ALG I* pays 60% to 67% of your previous salary, up to ~2,000€ per month.[^3] It also pays for your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung).

## Who can get unemployment benefits?

You get *ALG I* when you lose your job. You only get *ALG 1* if you have paid unemployment insurance for at least 12 months in the last 30 months.[^0] You must apply for *ALG I* at the *[[Bundesagentur für Arbeit]]*.[^1]

You can get unemployment benefits if:

- **You pay for unemployment insurance**  
    Almost all employees pay for unemployment insurance. If you are self-employed, you don't pay for it unless you choose to. Most self-employed people can't get unemployment benefits.
- **You have paid unemployment insurance for 12 of the last 30 months**  
    This means that if you worked in Germany for less than 12 months, you don't get unemployment benefits.

## When do I get unemployment benefits?

It depends on why you are unemployed. By default, you get benefits as soon as you are unemployed.

Sometimes, there is a disqualification period (*Sperrzeit*) of up to 12 weeks. During the *Sperrzeit*, you don't get any benefits.

## How much money do I get?
