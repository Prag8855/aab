When you are unemployed, you get unemployment benefits (*[[ALG I]]*). *ALG I* pays 60% to 67% of your previous salary, up to ~2,000€ per month.[^3] It also pays for your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung).

## Who gets unemployment benefits?

You get *ALG I* when you lose your job. You only get *ALG 1* if you have paid unemployment insurance for at least 12 months in the last 30 months.[^0] You must apply for *ALG I* at the *[[Bundesagentur für Arbeit]]*.[^1]

You can get unemployment benefits if:

- **You pay for unemployment insurance**  
    Almost all employees pay for unemployment insurance. If you are self-employed, you don't pay for it unless you choose to. Most self-employed people can't get unemployment benefits.
- **You have paid unemployment insurance for 12 of the last 30 months**  
    This means that if you worked in Germany for less than 12 months, you don't get unemployment benefits.

Unemployment benefits are not related to your immigration status. You can get unemployment benefits with a residence permit, a permanent residence or EU citizenship.

## When do I get unemployment benefits?

It depends on why you are unemployed. By default, you get benefits as soon as you are unemployed.

Sometimes, there is a disqualification period (*Sperrzeit*) of up to 12 weeks. During the *Sperrzeit*, you don't get any benefits.

## How much money do I get?
