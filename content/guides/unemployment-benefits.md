## Who gets unemployment benefits?

You get *[[ALG I]]* when you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job). You must apply for *ALG I* at the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]*.[^1]

You can get unemployment benefits if:[^0]

- **You are unemployed**
- **You can work**  
    You are healthy enough to work 15 hours per week.
- **You pay [unemployment insurance](/glossary/Arbeitslosenversicherung)**  
    Almost all employees pay for unemployment insurance, but most self-employed people don't.
- **You paid unemployment insurance for 12 of the last 30 months**[^11]  
    There are exceptions for sickness, parenting, short-term employment and many other reasons. If you are not sure, apply for unemployment benefits anyway.
- **You applied for unemployment benefits**  
    This is not automatic. I explain [how to apply for unemployment benefits](#how-to-apply-for-unemployment-benefits) below.

Your immigration status does not affect your unemployment benefits. You can get *ALG I* with a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or EU citizenship.

If you don't get *ALG I*, you might get *[[Bürgergeld]]* instead.

## When do I get unemployment benefits?

Usually, **as soon as you stop working**. Sometimes, There is a disqualification period (*Sperrzeit*) of 1 to 12 weeks. During the *Sperrzeit*, you don't get unemployment benefits.

There is a *Sperrzeit* when...

- **You choose to leave your job**  
    This means that you quit your job *without a reason*, or you sign an *Aufhebungsvertrag* with your employer. There are many good reasons to quit: mental health, bad salary, moving for your spouse, and more.[^14]
- **or you register too late**  
    If you wait too long to [register as a job seeker](#register-as-a-job-seeker) or [as unemployed](#register-as-unemployed), the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]* adds a *Sperrzeit* to punish you.
- **or you refuse help from the Agentur für Arbeit**[^13]  
    For example, you refuse a job offer, refuse to take recommended training, or refuse to look for work.

During the Sperrzeit, your employment benefits still run out (section 6)

## How much money do I get?

**60% of your [gross income](/glossary/Brutto%20income)**, or 67% if you have children.[^5] They use your average gross income of the last 12 months, including bonuses.[^12] They ignore your income above {{BEITRAGSBEMESSUNGSGRENZE_WEST|cur}}€ per year.

**[Unemployment benefits calculator](https://www.pub.arbeitsagentur.de/start.html)** (in German) - Agentur für Arbeit

You pay taxes on the money you get: [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer), [solidarity tax](/glossary/Solidaritätszuschlag) and [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung).[^6] After taxes, *ALG I* is still around 60% of your [net income](/glossary/Netto%20income).

## Receiving unemployment benefits

ALG I is paid every month??? by bank transfer. You need a bank account for this.

### Conditions to get ALG I

When you receive *ALG I*, the *Agentur für Arbeit* is your boss, and **finding work is your full time job**.

The *Agentur für Arbeit* really wants you to work. At first, they are nice and patient. After some time, they are more forceful.

To get *ALG I*, you must...

- **Try to find work**[^7]  
    You actively look for another job. You must prove that you are looking at job offers and applying for jobs.
- **Be reachable**[^8]  
    The *Agentur für Arbeit* expects you to answer your phone and read your mail. If you travel and you can't read your mail, you must tell them.
- **Be flexible**  
    You must be ready to accept jobs that are not ideal.

If you don't meet those conditions, they can stop paying *ALG I*, sometimes retroactively.[^9]

### Travelling

When you receive *ALG I*, you are supposed to look for work. Finding work is your full time job. If you want to take a vacation or travel, you need the *Agentur für Arbeit*'s permission. You get 20??? days of vacation from the job search per year.

People often travel without telling the *Agentur für Arbeit*. Most of the time, they don't notice. If they call you for an appointment, and they learn that you are on a beach in Spain, they can cut your unemployment benefits.

### Sickness and pregnancy

If you are sick, you can take sick days. You must have a note from the doctor.[^10] When you are healthy again, you must tell the *Agentur für Arbeit*. You can also take time off when your children are sick.

For the first 6 weeks, you get ALG I as normal. After 6 weeks, you stop getting ALG I, and you get *[[Krankengeld]]* from your health insurance instead.
