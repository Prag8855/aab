[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) is a [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) company in Germany. They are popular with freelancers who [move to Germany](/guides/moving-to-berlin), because they speak English, they have a nice app, and their insurance is [valid for a visa application](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance).

**But is it good?** I was curious, so I did some research. This is what I learned.

*This article was not suggested, written or approved by Ottonova. I have done independent research, and these opinions are my own.*

## Why does everyone recommend Ottonova?

**Because they get paid to do it.** Most Ottonova reviews are sponsored. Ottonova has an affiliate program. When a blogger brings them a customer, the blogger gets money. Ottonova pays the highest commissions in the industry,[^0] *by far*. Bloggers recommend Ottonova, because it's what pays the most.

It does not mean that Ottonova is bad, but it means that Ottonova recommendations are not honest. Most bloggers are not Ottonova customers, and they know nothing about German health insurance. You should not listen to their advice.

This review is fair and honest. I have talked with 3 health insurance brokers, and I have read hundreds of Ottonova reviews. I'm not trying to sell Ottonova. I just tell you the facts, and I let you decide.

## What should you know?

### It's private health insurance

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) sells [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung).

Before you choose health insurance, you must understand [how German health insurance works](/guides/german-health-insurance). Private health insurance is not always the best choice, even when it's cheaper. [In some cases](/guides/german-health-insurance#your-options), you can't even have private health insurance.

You should ask a health insurance broker before you choose health insurance. They can help you find better, cheaper health insurance. Their help is free.

### It's not the cheapest option

Ottonova is not the cheapest private health insurance. If that's what you want, use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-health) to compare health insurance prices.

But you should not just look at the price. The best health insurance depends on your situation. Read [this guide](/guides/german-health-insurance) to understand the German health insurance system. A health insurance broker can also help you pick the best insurance for your needs.

**Related guide:** [How to choose German health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance)

### They speak English

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) offers customer service in English, 24/7. If you don't speak German, this is a big benefit.

Public health insurers like [Techniker Krankenkasse](/guides/techniker-krankenkasse-review) and [AOK](/out/popsure-aok) *unofficially* have English customer service.

### They have a cool app

You can use the [Ottonova app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ottonova.mobile&hl=en&gl=US) to do a few things:

- Chat with their customer service, in English, and ask questions about your coverage
- Book an appointment with a doctor
- Book a video call with a doctor
- Upload invoices and documents
- Make health insurance claims

This is nice, but not unique. The [TK app](https://www.tk.de/techniker/magazin/digitale-gesundheit/apps/die-app-der-tk-2023650) has most of those features, and it's also available in English.[^1] You can use [Doctena](https://www.doctena.de/en/) to book an appointment with a doctor.

### It's valid for a German visa application

When you apply for a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), you need valid health insurance. Ottonova's health insurance is accepted by the German embassies, consulates and *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. Health insurance from Ottonova is valid for the [German freelance visa](/guides/how-to-get-a-german-freelance-visa), [work visa](/guides/german-work-visa)[^12] and Blue Card. Ottonova confirms this on [their home page](/out/ottonova-expats). They also have a [[BaFin]] licence.[^2]

If you [move to Germany as a freelancer](/guides/become-a-freelancer-in-germany), it's hard to get health insurance. Many private health insurers don't accept recent immigrants. In this case, Ottonova is a good option, because they accept immigrants. [Feather](/out/popsure-expats) also offers health insurance for expat freelancers. Health insurance brokers can also get you insured.

### It's a young insurance company

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) is only in business since June 2017.[^3] It's still a very small insurance company. In 2018, they had less 406 members.[^4] In 2019, they had 4,480 members, but only 860 had health insurance.[^5] In 2021, they had 14,050 members, but only 1,854 had health insurance.[^6] This is very little for a health insurer.

On the good side, Ottonova is growing quickly. They get thousands of new members every year. Their revenue also grows every year: 262% in 2019, 158% in 2020,[^7] and 61% in 2021.[^8] They could become a profitable health insurer.

On the bad side, Ottonova is still losing a lot of money. They lost 1.5 million euros in 2018,[^9] 2.4 million in 2019,[^10] 3.1 million euros in 2020, and 2.1 million euros in 2021.[^8]

Why is this important? Because health insurance is a long term decision. If you stay in Germany for a long time, you want stable health insurance. Small health insurers are riskier. In 2010, a private health insurer with 25,000 members almost went bankrupt because of two sick patients.[^11] [City BKK's bankruptcy](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/05/germ-m31.html) shows what happens to you if your health insurer goes bankrupt.

If you don't plan to live in Germany for a long time, this is not a big problem. If you want to stay in Germany longer, Ottonova is a bit risky.

## Summary

If you need [health insurance for your visa application](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance), Ottonova will work well, but there are [other options](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance). You can **[get a quote from Ottonova](/out/ottonova)**, and decide if it works for you.

You can read more about Ottonova on [the Ottonova website](/out/ottonova).

### Other options

- If you need a health insurer that speaks English, there is also [Techniker Krankenkasse](/guides/techniker-krankenkasse-review) and [AOK](/out/popsure-aok). Both are [public health insurers](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).
- If you need health insurance for your German visa, there are [many options](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance).

In my opinion, you should not choose your health insurance yourself. The best solution is to talk to a health insurance broker, and let them find the best insurance for you. They can help you get better, cheaper health insurance. Their help is completely free.

You can also use [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-health) to compare private health insurance prices. You enter some information about you, and they show you insurance options from different companies. It does not help you choose the best insurance; only the cheapest.
