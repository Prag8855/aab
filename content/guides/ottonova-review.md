## Summary

Ottonova is a very small insurer with great marketing.[^8] It's okay, but it's not special.[^1] You can find better, cheaper health insurance if you [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers).

If you need health insurance for a visa or residence permit application, there are [other options](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance).

## Don't trust the marketing

Bloggers recommend Ottonova because it pays well. If they convince you to choose Ottonova, they get 500€.[^0] These articles are not written by customers or by insurance experts. They are ads.

If you want a honest health insurance recommendation, talk to an [independent health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). It's the best way to choose health insurance, and it's free.

I also get paid to help you choose health insurance. I get paid no matter what you choose, so I want you to get the best possible option.

## What you need to know

### It's private health insurance

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) sells [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) and [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). It might not be the best option for you. Before you choose, [understand your options](/guides/german-health-insurance#your-options) and [how health insurance works](/guides/german-health-insurance).

### It's valid for a visa application

When you apply for a German visa or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), you need valid health insurance.

Ottonova's health insurance works for this. You can use it to apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa), [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or [[Blue Card]], for example.

### It's expensive

Ottonova is more expensive than comparable private health insurances. You can get a better deal if you [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers).[^1]

[Talk to a insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to find a cheaper option. Be careful; choosing the cheapest option can be a serious mistake, and cost you a lot of money later.

### They speak English

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) has 24/7 English-speaking customer service. If you don't speak German, this is very important.

Public health insurers like [Techniker Krankenkasse](/guides/techniker-krankenkasse-review), [AOK](/out/feather-aok) and [Barmer](/out/barmer) *unofficially* have English-speaking customer service. Their website is in German, but you can easily get help in English.

If you get health insurance from an English-speaking insurance broker, you can always get help from your broker. They can help you make insurance claims, and answer your insurance questions.

### It's a young insurance company

[Ottonova](/out/ottonova) is a very small health insurer, and **it's not profitable**. They lost 2.3 million euros in 2024.[^7]

They are in business since 2017.[^3] In 2023, they only had 5,470 clients with private health insurance.[^6] Other insurers have hundreds of thousands of customers. Their solvency rating is also below average.[^4]

Small health insurers are riskier. In 2010, a private health insurer with 25,000 members almost went bankrupt because of two sick patients.[^11] [City BKK's bankruptcy](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/05/germ-m31.html) shows what happens to you if your health insurer goes bankrupt.

If you plan to live in Germany for a long time, choose a stable health insurer.[^5]

## What experts say about Ottonova

This is what independent health insurance brokers think of Ottonova:

> "It’s a decent provider, but there is no real reason to chose them over others. They don’t have the best terms and conditions. They don’t have the best price/value. They are not the only one that is super digital. So as a broker, even though they pay really good commissions, it would not be my first or second choice/recommendation."  
> — Seamus Wolf, April 2025

> "As a newer player, it lacks the long-term track record and product breadth of traditional insurers. Always [get a comparison](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers), you might find better offers that suit your needs more closely."  
> — Emily Archer, April 2025

> "Let's put it this way: it's an insurance company like any other (only smaller) that has very good marketing."  
> — Mona Anbari, April 2025
