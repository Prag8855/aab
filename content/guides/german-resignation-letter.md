## What goes in a German resignation letter

Your resignation letter should be short and precise. Don't add unnecessary information; it could be used against you.[^10]

Your resignation letter must include:

- [ ] Your full name and address
- [ ] Your employee number (if you have one)
- [ ] Your employer's full name and address
- [ ] The date of your resignation
- [ ] The word *Kündigung* in the subject line
- [ ] The correct addressee - This is usually your manager, or the human resources department.[^7]
- [ ] Your signature - Sign the letter by hand. A digital signature, a scanned signature, initials or a stamp are not enough.[^11]

Your resignation letter can include:

- [ ] Your contact information - Useful if your employer needs to contact you in the future.
- [ ] A request for a reference letter (*[[Arbeitszeugnis]]*)
- [ ] A request for an *[[Urlaubsbescheinigung]]*
- [ ] A note to thank your employer and your team

Your resignation letter should **not** include:

- Why you quit your job[^6]
- What you plan to do next
- Feedback for your employer or your team

### Language of your resignation letter

If you work in an English-speaking office, you can write your resignation letter in English. It's safer to write it in German.[^9]

## How to give your resignation letter

Your resignation letter must be **printed and signed**. An email, a fax, an instant message or a conversation is not enough.[^1] Your resignation is only official when your employer receives your resignation letter.

There are two ways to give your resignation letter.

- **In person** (recommended)[^8]  
    Give your resignation letter to your employer in person. Bring a witness that can confirm that it happened.[^5] This is the best option, because you can guarantee that your employer received your resignation. It's also more polite.
- **By post**  
    Send your resignation letter by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief). Your notice period begins when your employer receives your resignation, not when you send it.[^12] This can delay your resignation.

Your employer does not need to confirm or accept your resignation. 

### Who should receive the letter

**Ask your employer.** You usually give the resignation letter to your manager, or to the human resources department.

## What happens next

When your employer receives your resignation letter, your notice period (*Kündigungsfrist*) begins.
