## How much money will I get back?

You will get a refund for all your pension payments.[^37] That's **around {{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_EMPLOYEE_CONTRIBUTION}}% of your [gross income](/glossary/Brutto%20income)**. That means you usually get a few thousand euros back.[^14] Use the [pension refund calculator](/tools/pension-refund-calculator) to get an exact answer.

You will not get a refund for your employer's contributions.[^15] If you already benefits from the Deutsche Rentenversicherung, the refund will be smaller.[^38] You can't receive a refund for contributions made in East Germany before June 30 1990.[^16]

If you are a freelancer, you will only get 50% of your pension payments back ({{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_EMPLOYEE_CONTRIBUTION}}% of your income).[^17] By default, freelancers do not make public pension payments. If you did not make public pension payments, you will not get any money back.

{% include '_blocks/pensionRefundCalculator.html' %}

To know the exact amount, [request a *Versicherungsverlauf*](/out/drv-pension-payments-info) from the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]. It will arrive by post in 1 to 3 weeks. If you have an [[eID]], you can [get a *Versicherungsverlauf* instantly](https://kundenportal.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/od-kundenportal).

[Germany Pension Refund](/out/germany-pension-refund) and [FundsBack](/out/fundsback) can also check the pension refund amount for you, for free.

## How to ask for a pension refund

The pension refund is not automatic. You must apply for it. You can do it yourself, or ask someone to do it for you.

### Do it yourself

If you apply yourself, it costs nothing. You need to fill a few different forms, and send them to the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]. They will write back to you, and ask for more documents. After a few months, you will get a refund.

**This can be really easy, or really hard**.[^18] The refunds are managed by different employees in different offices, and there is a lot of confusion. The forms are simple, but each employee asks for different things. If there is a problem, they just wait until you contact them again. For example, if a letter is lost in the mail (they don't use [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief)), nothing happens until you contact them again. The Deutsche Rentenversicherung contacts you by post, in German. This can add long delays.

If you want to do it yourself, here are the steps:[^19]

1. **Wait 24 months after your last pension payment**  
    After your last mandatory pension payment, you must wait 24 months to apply for a refund.[^20] Your last payment usually is one month after your last day of work. For example, if your last day of work was on March 5, 2018, your last payment was in April 2018. You can apply for a refund in May 2020. While you wait, you can still prepare the documents. It's easier if you prepare the documents while you are in Germany.
2. **Find your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and your [social insurance number](/glossary/Sozialversicherungsnummer)**  
    You need those numbers to fill the forms. Use [this guide](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#the-tax-id-steuer-id) to find your tax ID, and [this guide](/guides/german-versicherungsnummer) to find your social insurance number.
3. **Download [this form package](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/Formularpakete/01_versicherte/01_vor_der_rente/_DRV_Paket_Versicherung_Erstattung_von_Beitr%C3%A4gen.html), and fill the correct form**  
    If you need help to fill the forms, you can [book an appointment with the DRV](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/DRV/DE/Beratung-und-Kontakt/Beratung-suchen-und-buchen/beratung-suchen-und-buchen_node.html). You can also call them, but they only speak German.
    1. If you are Turkish, you must fill form [form E5816](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/E5816.html) (previously A5800). This form is in Turkish and German. The instructions are in [document E5817](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/E5817.html) (previously A5801) (in German).
    2. If you are not Turkish, you must fill the standard form.[^21] The instructions are in [document V0910](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0910.html) (in German).
        - [Form V0900](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0900.html) in German, 
        - **or** form V0901 in [English](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0901_englisch.html), [French](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0901_franzoesisch.html), [Italian](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0901_italienisch.html) or [Spanish](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/V0901_spanisch.html)
4. **Download and fill the payment information form** (*Zahlungserklärung*)  
    If you use a bank in another country, your refund will take 2 months longer. The payment information form asks for a PANR, a BXNR and a ZANR. You don't have those numbers.[^22] Leave those fields empty.  
    1. If the bank account is in Germany, fill [form A1310](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/A1310.html). Transfers to German bank accounts are *much* faster.
    2. If the bank account is in Canada or the United States, fill [form A1312](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/A1312.html).
    3. If the bank account is in Italy, fill [form A1311](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/A1311.html).
    4. If the bank account is in any other country, fill [form A1310](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Formulare/DE/_pdf/A1310.html).  
5. **Collect the other documents**[^39]
    - [ ] **A certified copy of your passport**  
        The German embassy or consulate can make a certified copy of your passport. The information in your passport must be the same as in the application forms.
    - [ ] **A copy of your [[Meldebescheinigung zur Sozialversicherung]]**  
        You can use an older one. It doesn't have to be the latest one.
    - [ ] **Deregistration certificate** (*[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*)  
        This proves that you do not live in Germany anymore. They do not always ask for this document.
    - [ ] **Proof that you live in your current country**[^23]  
        This can be a certificate from the tax office, a registration certificate, or anything that proves that you live in that country. In some cases, you must go to a German embassy to verify your identity. The Deutsche Versicherung will tell you what they need after you apply. It's different for everyone.
    - [ ] **Power of attorney** (*[[Vollmacht]]*)  
        If you apply for someone else, or someone else applies for you, include a *Vollmacht*.
6. **Send everything to the Deutsche Rentenversicherung**  
    Send all the required forms and documents to *Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund 10704 Berlin.*[^24] Don't send the documents before the end of the 2 year waiting period. If you send your documents too early, they will send them back to you.
7. **Wait for an answer**  
    The Deutsche Rentenversicherung will review your case. If they need more documents, they will contact you.[^25] They will contact you by post, in German. You might need to mail more documents later.[^26] You might need to go to the German embassy or consulate to prove that you live in that country. Each employee wants something different. You must be patient.
8. **Get your refund**  
    The Deutsche Rentenversicherung will send you a letter to confirm that you want your refund.[^27] After you confirm, you might wait another 6 weeks before you get your refund.

### Get help from someone

You can let someone take care of everything. There are good reasons to get help:

- **You don't need to speak German**  
    You can write to the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]] in English, but they will answer in German. They will often request more documents, and more information. If you don't speak German, it can be confusing.
- **You don't need a fixed address**  
    The Deutsche Rentenversicherung will contact you by post. If you don't have a fixed address, or if the post is not reliable, this can be a problem.
- **Your case is processed faster**  
    The [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]] communicates by post.[^28] If you live far from Germany, this can delay your refund by a few weeks. They do not use [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief), so if a letter gets lost, you will wait much longer.
- **You get your money faster**  
    If you want to receive your refund in a non-German bank account, you must wait an extra 2 months. Germany Pension Refund, FundsBack and TaxBack can receive the money in a German bank account, and transfer it directly to you. This saves you two months of waiting. They also offer more payment options than the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]].
- **You pay lower transaction fees**  
    Germany Pension Refund and FundsBack offer more payment options than the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]. They can use services like [Wise](/out/wise) to transfer the money with lower transaction fees.

These businesses can help you request a refund. They will fill the forms and request the refund for you. They can also check how much money you will get back.

- **[Pension Refund Germany](/out/german-pension-refund)**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    Their fee is 10% of your refund (maximum fee 2,800€).[^31] They automated the process, so you do everything online. They pay you in the currency you prefer. They work with a lawyer.
- **[Germany Pension Refund](/out/germany-pension-refund)**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    Their fee is 9.75% of your refund (no minimum or maximum fee).[^30] They specialise in pension refunds since 2007. They helped me a lot, and they verified this guide many times. Every case goes through their lawyers.
- **[FundsBack](/out/fundsback)**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    Their fee is 9.9% of your refund (minimum fee 899€, maximum 2,899€), or 9.405% if you use the link above.[^29] They specialise in pension refunds since 2017. Their lawyer helped me a lot, and he verified this guide many times. Every case goes through their lawyer.
- **[TaxBack](/out/taxback)**  
    Their fee is 19.8% of your refund,[^32] or minimum 60€. I do not recommend them. They don't specialise in pension refunds, and their fee is too high.
- **[Germany Mantra](/out/germany-mantra)**  
    Unknown fees. This company is based in India.[^33] They offer relocation services for Indians since at least 2011.[^34] They don't answer my emails.

The *[[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]* can also help you fill the forms. Their email is <meinefrage@drv-bund.de>. You can also write in English, but they will answer in German. You can also [book an appointment](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/DRV/DE/Beratung-und-Kontakt/Beratung-suchen-und-buchen/beratung-suchen-und-buchen_node.html) and visit them in person.

## How long does it take to get a refund?

You must wait at least 24 months after your last pension payment.[^17] After 24 months, you can ask for a refund. After you submit the form, it takes **1 to 6 months** to get a refund.[^35] It's a long process, and it's sometimes complicated.[^18] You can start the process a few months before you are eligible for a refund. This gives you more time to prepare the documents you need.

## How is the money refunded?

The *[[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]* will transfer the money to your bank account. They can send the money to any bank account, not just German bank accounts.[^36] Transfers to German bank accounts are *much* faster.

## Need help?

If you have questions, write to the [[Deutsche Rentenversicherung]]. Their email is <meinefrage@drv-bund.de>. You can write in English, but they will reply in German. You can also [book an appointment](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/DRV/DE/Beratung-und-Kontakt/Beratung-suchen-und-buchen/beratung-suchen-und-buchen_node.html) with them, or call them. I called them many times, and they always helped, but they only speak German.

[Germany Pension Refund](/out/germany-pension-refund), [FundsBack](/out/fundsback), [Pension Refund Germany](/out/german-pension-refund), [Taxback](/out/taxback) or [Germany Mantra](/out/germany-mantra) can request a refund for you. They will take care of everything, but they charge a fee for their service.

Tax advisors rarely have experience with German pension refunds. German embassies and consulates do not help you with German pension refunds.
