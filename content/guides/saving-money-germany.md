## Taxes and social contributions

Most employees pay 35% to 50% of their income in taxes, health insurance and pension contributions. There are ways to pay less.

### How to pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer)

- **Make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung)**  
    A tax declaration lets you deduct expenses from your income. This makes your taxable income smaller, so you pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer). Relocation costs, business expenses, commuting, pension payments, insurance and healthcare are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). [Tax software](/guides/german-tax-software) is the cheapest way to make a tax declaration.
- **Save for retirement**  
    Pension contributions are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). Contributing to your pension is a type of [tax deferral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_deferral). It helps you pay less income tax over your lifetime.

### How to pay less for [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)

- **Use your EHIC card**  
    If you come from another EU country, you can use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in Germany. You might not need German health insurance. - [More information](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-from-other-eu-countries)
- **Switch to [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    It's *sometimes* much cheaper. I save over 400€ per month. This is a very complex decision and it can be an expensive mistake. I strongly recommend that you [talk to a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) first.
- **Choose a different [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    Pick an insurer with a lower *[[Zusatzbeitrag]]*. You can save up to 500€ per year.
- **Join the [[Künstlersozialkasse]]**  
    If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher, [join the *Künstlersozialkasse* (*KSK*)](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your pension insurance. It's always worth it.

Use my health insurance calculator to see your options. If you need help, [talk to a broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). It's free.

### How to pay less [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung)

- **Join the Künstlersozialkasse**  
    If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher, [join the *Künstlersozialkasse* (*KSK*)](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your pension insurance. It's always worth it.
- **Get a pension payments refund**  
    If you leave Germany, you can sometimes [get your pension payments refunded](/guides/pension-payments-refund). You can get [thousands of euros](/tools/pension-refund-calculator) back.

### How to pay less [church tax](/glossary/Kirchensteuer)

- **[Leave the church](https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/stop-paying-german-church-tax/)**  
    If you leave the church, you stop paying the church tax. You can save a few hundred euros per year.

## Housing

### Rent

Rent is the biggest expense for most people. There are ways to pay less rent:

- **Lower your rent**  
    If your rent is above the legal limit, you can get it reduced. Use a [rent limit calculator](https://mietencheck.de) to check if you pay too much. A *[[Mieterverein]]*, [Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse), or a [lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) can reduce your rent. You can save a few hundred euros per month.
- **Know your rights**  
    Avoid [housing scams](/guides/housing-scams). If you pay a bribe to get an apartment, or pay too much for a kitchen or furniture, you can get that money back. Talk to a lawyer or a *[[Mieterverein]]*.
- **Move somewhere else**  
    [Look for a cheaper apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) in a cheaper neighbourhood. I moved from Mitte to Französisch Buchholz to save 400€ per month. Finding a new apartment can be extremely hard, but if you already have one, you have more time to look.

### Utilities

- **Change electricity and gas providers**  
    Energy companies give rebates to new customers. When the rebate expires, switch to another company.[^0] Do this every year before your contract renews. You can save around 100€ to 200€ per year. Use [Verivox](/out/verivox-electricity) or [Check24](/out/check24-electricity) to find another energy company.
- **Stop paying the TV tax**  
    When you receive financial aid (*[[Bürgergeld]]* or *[[BAföG]]*), fill [this form](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/buergerinnen_und_buerger/formulare/befreiung_oder_ermaessigung_beantragen/index_ger.html) to stop paying the TV tax.

## Transportation

- **[Get the Deutschland Ticket](/guides/deutschland-ticket)**{% include '_blocks/recommended.html' %}  
    It's the cheapest monthly ticket, and it lets you use public transit everywhere in Germany.
- **Get a yearly ticket**  
    If you can't get the Deutschland Ticket, [get a yearly subscription](https://www.bvg.de/de/abos-und-tickets/alle-abos/vbb-umweltkarte) from BVG or the Deutsche Bahn. Yearly tickets are cheaper than monthly tickets.
- **Get a student ticket**  
    If you are a student or a trainee, get a student ticket. It's usually included in your school fees.
- **Don't drive**  
    In most cities, [you don't need a car](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany#do-you-need-a-car). [Buy a bicycle](/guides/bicycle-in-berlin) or [use public transit](/guides/public-transit) instead. When you really need to drive, [rent a car](/guides/public-transit#rent-a-car).
- **Save on car insurance**  
    If you drive a car, there are many [ways to pay less for car insurance](/guides/car-insurance-germany#how-to-pay-less-for-german-car-insurance). You can save a few euros per month.

## Finances

- **Choose a bank with low fees**  
    Find a bank that has no monthly fee and no ATM fees. [N26](/out/n26), [ING](/out/ing) and [DKB](/out/dkb) are the most popular ones, but there are [many other options](/guides/best-bank-germany#free-bank-accounts).
- **Combine your insurance policies**  
    If you get all your insurances from the same company, you sometimes pay less. Combined [liability](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) and [household insurance](/glossary/Hausratversicherung) can be cheaper.[^2] Don't [legal insurance](/glossary/Rechtsschutzversicherung) from the same company, in case you need to sue the insurance company.[^3]
- **Talk to a financial advisor**  
    If you have enough money to invest and save for retirement, talk to a financial advisor. Be careful; many of them are really bad. Choose one that works with immigrants, because your needs are different. My financial advisor is Seamus at [Horizon65](/out/horizon65).

## Other tips

- **Pay yearly, not monthly**  
    [Car insurance](/guides/car-insurance-germany), [liability insurance](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung), public transit and other subscriptions are cheaper if you pay yearly.[^4]
- **Compare prices often**  
    Every year, before your contract renews, look for a cheaper option. You can get a better deal for electricity, gas, insurance, internet and mobile phone service. [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck), [Check24](/out/check24) and [Verivox](/out/verivox-cellphone) are the main price comparison websites. They don't show you all options.
- **Negotiate a better price**  
    When your internet contract is about to expire, call the company and ask for a better price. They will renew your contract, but give you a better plan. Vodafone gave me a free upgrade from 100 Mbit/s to 300 Mbit/s.
