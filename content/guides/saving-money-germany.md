## Change electricity and gas providers every year

- **Total savings:** 100 to 200€ per year
- **Effort required:** 30 minutes every year

Most electricity and gas providers offer a bonus for new customers. In the first year, their service is cheaper. After one year, the price goes up. If you don't cancel your contract, it will be renewed automatically for 1 more year.

If you switch to a new electricity provider every year, you always get a new customer bonus. If you do this, you will save over 100€ per year. This is not a secret; many Germans do it[^0]. It takes less than 30 minutes to switch. Use [Verivox](/out/verivox-electricity) to find a cheaper electricity provider. Verivox will automatically transfer your contract to the new electricity provider. I tried it, and it works really well. [Check24](/out/check24-electricity) has a similar service.

Each electricity provider has a different cancellation period (*[[Kündigungsfrist]]*). For example, Vattenfall has a *Kündigungsfrist* of 6 weeks. You must cancel your contract at least 6 weeks before it ends. If you don't, the contract is renewed automatically for 1 year. Put a reminder in your calendar every year.

You can also do this with [car insurance](/guides/car-insurance-germany). Most car insurance contracts must be cancelled 3 months before they expire.

## Pay less for health insurance

[Health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung) is often your second biggest expense, after rent. There are many ways to pay less for health insurance. My [health insurance calculator](/tools/health-insurance-calculator) shows you what options you have.

### Use your EHIC card

If you come from another EU country, **you can use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in Germany**. If you get healthcare in Germany, your health insurance in your home country pays for it.

If health insurance is cheaper in your home country, using your EHIC is cheaper than getting German health insurance. You can save a lot of money every month with the EHIC.

This only works in certain cases. For example, if you are a student from another EU country, or if you are unemployed.

### Switch to private health insurance

- **Total savings:** 100 to 500€ per month
- **Effort required:** fill a few forms, take a medical exam, wait up to 3 months

Public health insurance is usually the best option, but in [some specific cases](/guides/german-health-insurance), private health insurance makes more sense. For example, if you are a freelancer with a high income, you can save up to 500€ per month with private health insurance, *and* you get better coverage. This happened to me. My health insurance broker ([Feather](/out/popsure)) helped me find private health insurance. I save over 400€ per month.

**This is not a simple decision.** Private health insurance is not always a better option. This decision has serious long term consequences. Talk to a health insurance broker first. Their help is free.

{% include 'blocks/_healthInsuranceQuestion.html' %}

Public health insurance has a 3 month *[[Kündigungsfrist]]*. If you decide to switch to private health insurance, you must stay another 3 months on public health insurance.

### Join the [Künstlersozialkasse (KSK)](/glossary/Künstlersozialkasse)

- **Total savings:** 0€, but you get a free public pension
- **Effort required:** 3-6 months of waiting and a lot of paperwork

If you are a freelance artist, publicist or art teacher, the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK) can pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung). You keep the same health insurance, and the same coverage, but you pay half the price.

It takes time to get accepted, but it's really worth it.

## Lower your rent

- **Total savings:** 0 to 300€ per month
- **Effort required:** [fill an online form](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse-calculator), sign a *[[Vollmacht]]*, and wait a few months

You might be paying too much rent. The *[[Mietpreisbremse]]* limits how much your landlord can charge for rent. If your rent is above the legal limit, you can [hire a lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) and get it reduced.

[Conny](/out/conny-mietpreisbremse) is a company that helps people reduce their rent. [My review of Conny](/guides/wenigermiete-review) explains how it works. Your [tenant's association](/glossary/Mieterverein) can also help you with this.

## Choose a bank with low fees

- **Total savings:** 10 to 30€ per month
- **Effort required:** 1 day

Some banks charge a monthly fee to keep your money. It's usually around 10€ per month. Some banks also charge you a fee when you use another bank's ATM. There are many banks with no monthly fees, and no ATM fees. [N26](/out/n26), [ING](/out/ing) and [DKB](/out/dkb) are the most popular ones, but there are [many other options](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany#german-banks-with-no-monthly-fees).

**[How to choose a bank ➞ Banks with no monthly fees](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany#german-banks-with-no-monthly-fees)**

## Get a yearly public transit pass

- **Total savings:** 250 to 500€ per year
- **Effort required:** 1 hour

There are 3 ways to save money on public transit passes:

- **Get a subscription**  
    The pass is renewed automatically, and the money is taken from your bank account. You must cancel the subscription in advance.
- **Buy a yearly pass**  
    It's cheaper if you pay once per year, instead of every month.
- **Get a 10-Uhr-Karte**  
    The 10-Uhr-Karte is cheaper, but it does not work between 3AM and 10AM on weekdays.

## Move to a cheaper area

- **Total savings:** 100 to 400€ per month
- **Effort required:** a few weeks

You do not need to live in the centre of Berlin. There are many great neighbourhoods just outside the *[[Ringbahn]]*. I moved from Mitte to Pankow, and I save 400€ per month on rent. That's almost 5,000€ per year!

Moving can cost a lot of money. You might need to repaint the old apartment, rent a moving truck, buy boxes, and buy new appliances. My last move cost me around 500€.

## Combine your insurance policies

- **Total savings:** varies
- **Effort required:** varies

If you get all of your insurances from the same company, you usually pay less[^1]. Some companies offer combined insurance policies that include [liability](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) and [household insurance](/glossary/Hausratversicherung)[^2].

There is one exception: legal insurance (*[[Rechtsschutzversicherung]]*). Do not get your legal insurance from the same company as your other insurances. If you have a problem with your other insurances, you will sue the same company that sold you legal insurance. They might refuse to help you[^3].

**[How to choose legal insurance ➞](/guides/legal-insurance)**

## Pay yearly, not monthly

- **Total savings:** 10 to 100€ per year
- **Effort required:** none

[Car insurance](/guides/car-insurance-germany), [liability insurance](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung) and most memberships are cheaper if you pay 1 year in advance, instead of every month[^4]. You get the same service, but you pay less.
