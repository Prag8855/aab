A *[[Kitagutschein]]* is a voucher that provides your child with free childcare in Berlin. A number of factors determine your child’s eligibility for a *Kitagutschein.* Childcare in a *Kita* is free for all children. However, you must still apply for a *Kitagutschein*. You may also need to pay extra costs to the *Kita* for food, outings, and special events.

## Who can get a Kitagutschein?

You can apply for a *Kitagutschein* for any child that...

- ...lives in Berlin
- ...is [registered](/glossary/Anmeldung) in Berlin
- ...is not old enough to go to school

Children can go to the *Kita* for up to 9 hours for free. It depends on their age.

- **Children under 1 year old** can go to *Kita* or have a nanny (*Tagesmutter*) for a 4 to 5 hours per day. This is called half days or *halbtags* childcare. You must prove that your child requires it. You can do this by showing your work contract or freelance work commitments. Children who live in homeless shelters or collective housing can also get *halbtags* care.
- **Children over 1 year old** get 5 to 9 free *Kita* hours per day.[^0]
    - **By default**, children over 1 year old get 5 to 7 *Kita* hours per day. This is called part-time or *teilzeit* childcare.
    - **If both parents are working, studying or in training**, they get 7 to 9 *Kita* hours per day. This is called full time or *ganztags* childcare. If only one parent is working, studying or in training, they only get *teilzeit* childcare.

If you want your child to spend more hours at the *Kita* than allowed, you must prove that your working hours make it necessary.[^1] If you work situation changes, you can apply for more *Kita* hours later.

## Cost of a Kitagutschein

The *Kitagutschein* is free for everyone. However, some Kitas will charge extra for meals and activities.

Typically, you will pay around 23€ per month for meals, and 60€ to 90€ per month for activities.

It takes 6 to 8 weeks to get a *Kitagutschein*. It's valid for 3 months after you sign a contract with the *Kita*.[^3]

## 1. Apply online or by post

There are two ways to apply for a *Kitagutschein*: **online**, or **by post**.

### Apply online

### Applying at the Jugendamt

You can also apply in person at your local *Jugendamt*. When you apply in person, they give you a receipt. You can show this receipt to the *Kitas* until you get a *Kitagutschein*.[^3]

## 2. Receive your Kitagutschein

You can choose to get the *Kitagutschein* by post or by email. **You will get it 6 to 8 weeks after you apply**.[^2] **It will be valid for 3 months**.[^3] The *Kitagutschein* states how many hours your child is entitled to, and includes information about the legal basis for the voucher.

Give a copy of your *Kitagutschein* to the *Kita*. The *Kita* will tell the State.

## 3. Look for a Kita

Start searching as soon as possible. Do not wait for your *[[Kitagutschein]]* to start searching.[^5] This is the hardest part of the process.
