When you [start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany) and list it to the German Trade Register (*[[Handelsregister]]*), you get a *Handelsregisternummer*.

Some businesses have no *Handelsregisternummer*, because they are not in the *Handelsregister*.

## What does the Registernummer look like?

The *Handelsregisternummer* has the format **HRA 12345** or **HRB 12345**:

- **HRA** is for a sole proprietorship (*Einzelunternehmen*), and **HRB** is for an incorporated company (*Kapitalgesellschaft*).[^1]
- **12345** is the unique number of this business.
- There is sometimes an extra letter. For example, **HRB 247469 B**.

Examples:

- N26 bank: HRB 247469 B
- Coup: HRB 178881 B
- SAP: HRA 350654

## How do I get a Handelsregisternummer?

You must list your business in the *Handelsregister*. You can ask for this when you fill the *[[Fragebogen zur steuerlichen Erfassung]]* in [[ELSTER]].

All businesses must be in the *Handelsregister*, except:

- Small businesses (*[[Kleinunternehmer]]*)
- Freelancers (*[[Freiberufler]]*)
- Companies constituted under civil law (*GbR*)

A *Handelsregister* comes with benefits, but also extra fees and responsibilities.[^2] Avoid it if you can.

## Where do I find a company's Registernummer?

- On the imprint (*[[Impressum]]*) page of their website. All commercial websites in Germany have this page. There is usually a link to the *Impressum* at the bottom of every page.
- By [searching for it](https://www.online-handelsregister.de/) in an online registry.
