## Put your name on the mailbox

German apartment buildings rarely have individual apartment numbers. You have the same address as everyone in your building. [If your name is not on your mailbox](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox), you won't get mail addressed to you. You must add "c/o" or "bei" to your address.

## Learn to write your new address

German addresses are a little different. Learn to write yours correctly.

## Register your address

Register your address at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. This is called the *[[Anmeldung]]*.

**[How to register your address ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

The *Bürgeramt* will tell these people your new address:

- **Your church**  
    If you pay the [church tax](/glossary/Kirchensteuer), your church will know about your address change.
- **The TV tax** (*[[Rundfunkbeitrag]]*)  
    The *[[ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice]]* knows when you change your address. They will collect the TV tax for your new address.
- **The Ausländerbehörde**  
    Bring your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to your *Anmeldung* appointment. They will put a sticker on it with your new address. You don't need to go to the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* to update your residence permit.
- **The Kfz-Zulassungsstelle**  
    Bring your [vehicle registration papers](/glossary/Zulassungsbescheinigung) to your *Anmeldung* appointment. They will put a sticker on them with your new address. It costs {{VEHICLE_UMMELDUNG_FEE|cur}}€ per vehicle.
