## Put your name on your mailbox

German apartments rarely have apartment numbers. Everyone in the building has the same address. Each person has a mailbox with their name on it. **If there is no mailbox with your name on it, you will not receive your mail.**

Ask your landlord to put your name on your mailbox and doorbell. Your landlord can't charge you a fee for this.[^4] If your name is not on the lease, your landlord can refuse to put your name on the mailbox.[^3]

If you can't put your name on your mailbox, [add "c/o" or "bei" to your address](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox).

## Learn to write your new address

**[How to address letters in Germany ➞](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany)**

## Register your address

Register your address at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. This is called the *[[Anmeldung]]*. If you can't put your name on the mailbox, [add "c/o" or "bei"](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox) to your official address.

**[How to register your address ➞](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)**

The *Bürgeramt* will tell these people your new address:

- **Your church**  
    If you pay the [church tax](/glossary/Kirchensteuer), your church will know about your address change.
- **The TV tax** (*[[Rundfunkbeitrag]]*)  
    The *[[ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice]]* knows when you change your address. They will collect the TV tax for your new address.
- **The Ausländerbehörde**  
    Bring your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to your *Anmeldung* appointment. They will put a sticker on it with your new address. You don't need to go to the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* to update your residence permit.
- **The Kfz-Zulassungsstelle**  
    Bring your [vehicle registration papers](/glossary/Zulassungsbescheinigung) to your *Anmeldung* appointment. They will put a sticker on them with your new address. It costs {{VEHICLE_UMMELDUNG_FEE|cur}}€ per vehicle.

## Notify everyone

    - [ ] **If you have a dog**  
        Tell the *Finanzamt* about your address change. This is because you must pay a dog tax (*[[Hundesteuer]]*). [This guide](/guides/hundesteuer) shows you how to change your address.
