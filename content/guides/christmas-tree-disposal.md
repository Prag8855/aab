Every year in January, [BSR](/glossary/Berliner%20Stadtreinigung) collects old Christmas trees in Berlin. This is a free service. The Christmas tree pickup dates can be found on the [BSR website](https://www.bsr.de/frohe-umwelt-fur-unsere-weihnachten-23170.php).

## Step 1: find the collection dates

[BSR](/glossary/Berliner%20Stadtreinigung) picks up old Christmas trees on specific dates every year. Usually, they collect on two different days, in January. The dates depend on your address. You can find the correct dates [on the BSR website](https://www.bsr.de/frohe-umwelt-fur-unsere-weihnachten-23170.php).

## Step 2: leave your tree on the sidewalk

1 or 2 days before a collection day, remove all the decorations from the tree, and bring it outside.[^0] Leave the tree on the sidewalk, close to the street. The tree must not be in the way or block the sidewalk.
