    They might know a good dealer. Just ask. You will find at least one friend who has a safe, reliable dealer. You will get better, cheaper, safer weed this way. People you have just met will not always introduce you to their dealer.
2. **[Telegram](https://telegram.org/)**  
    This is the easiest option if your friends don't know any dealers. It's a common way to buy weed in Berlin. There are many Telegram groups you can join. Some groups are run by a single dealer, and others let dealers and buyers find each other.

## Buying weed from Görlitzer and Hasenheide park

In Berlin, two parks have the most drug dealers:

- **[Görlitzer park](https://g.page/Goerli?share)** in Kreuzberg  
    A big central park in Berlin. It's famous for drug trafficking.[^0] The drug dealers are everywhere. They are hard to miss.[^1] It's safe to spend time in the park, at least during the day. Parents go there with their children. The police often targets this park.[^2]
- **[Hasenheide park](https://goo.gl/maps/Mq2BLcn7TEYogDAE7)** in Neukölln  
    A bigger park with fewer drug dealers. It's a better, safer park with an open air cinema and a petting zoo. The drug dealers are hard to miss.[^3]

**Buying weed from parks is a bad idea**. If you still want to do it, it works like this:

1. Talk to a drug dealer standing near the walking path. They are very hard to miss.
2. The dealer will ask you what you want, then point to his friend who hides in the bushes. Many dealers speak English.
3. His friend in the bushes will ask you how much weed you want. He will get take some weed from a bag he hides in a tree. He will put weed in your hand. He will not use a scale to weigh the weed, and you will not get a bag. You can try to negotiate and get a little more weed.
4. Pay in cash, and leave. You should have the exact amount of money in your hand.

Dealers are easy to find. They are everywhere in the park. They will even approach you when you walk through the park. Some people say that you should avoid the dealers near the entrance, and choose dealers deeper in the park.

### Is buying weed from parks safe?

**No.** The weed you buy from random dealers is not safe. Most of the time, you will get contaminated weed. Dealers and park usually sell low quality weed that is contaminated with chemicals.[^4] These chemicals irritate your throat and leave a bad taste in your mouth. You will often get [Brix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUg6xa3oysg) and grit weed in Berlin's parks. It might improve after legalisation.

You can also get caught with the police. They sometimes stay around the park's entrance, and stop people with drugs on them. They are more active in Görlitzer park.[^2]

## Buying weed from Telegram

Different groups have different methods.

Usually, you set a meeting location. The person that runs the group will start a secret chat to ask for more details. Some groups ask for a selfie to prove your identity, and for the driver to find you. When you end the secret chat, your photo is deleted.

You will receive a message when the driver is near you. The driver will pick you up. You must sit in the car. They might drive a few hundred meters with you. You must give your money to the driver, get your weed, get out of the car and leave. Be subtle, and do not flash your money near other people.

### Is buying weed from Telegram safe?

**No.** Marijuana from Telegram is often better than weed from the parks in Berlin, but it can still be contaminated.[^5] It might improve after legalisation.

In Berlin, weed is sometimes contaminated with synthetic cannabinoids (also called K2 or Spice). Hash can also be contaminated with synthetic cannabinoids.[^6]

This type of contaminated weed is bad for your mental and physical health.[^7] The high is shorter, stronger and less pleasant. It is addictive, and it can cause psychosis and withdrawal symptoms.[^8]

You *can't* see if your weed is contaminated with a synthetic cannabinoid test kit. They are not made for this.[^9] You can see synthetic cannabinoids with a microscope, or a very strong magnifying glass.[^10] If the weed is contaminated, you might see crystals on the surface.
