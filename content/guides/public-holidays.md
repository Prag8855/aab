### Employees get a paid vacation day

On public holidays, employees get the day off, but still get paid.

You celebrate the holidays of the state where you work, even if you live in a different state.[^0] For example, if you live in Brandenburg and you work in Berlin, you get a day off for International Women's Day, even if it's not a holiday in Brandenburg.

### Each state is different

Each German state has [different public holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Germany#List_by_state). For example, Women's Day is a public holiday in Berlin, but not Epiphany or Corpus Christi.[^1] Some states have more public holidays than other. Bavaria has 13 public holidays, but Berlin only has 10.
