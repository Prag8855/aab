After you [move to Berlin](/guides/moving-to-berlin), [find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) and [move in](/guides/moving-in), you must register your address at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. This is called the *Anmeldung*. All German residents must do it.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Why you must register your address

**All residents must register**, it's the law.[^33] [If you can't register](#if-you-cant-register-your-address), it makes your life harder. 

You must register your address to...

- **Use government services**  
    Without a registered address, you can't [start a business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany), get [child benefits](/glossary/Kindergeld) or get a [daycare voucher](/glossary/Kitagutschein).[^0] These services are only for official Berlin residents.
- **Get a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung)** (*Meldebestätigung*)  
    You sometimes need it to prove your address, open a bank account, get a SIM card, and a few other things.
- **Get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer)**  
    You get a tax ID by post around 4 weeks after your *Anmeldung*. You can [get a tax ID without an *Anmeldung*](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id). - [Why you need a tax ID](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#why-you-need-a-tax-id)
    - **Get paid correctly**  
        Your employer needs your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) to calculate your [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer). If you don't have a tax ID, you pay more [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer), so your paychecks are much smaller. You don't lose that money, but you must make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung) to get it back. - [More information](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#why-you-need-a-tax-id)
- **Apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    The *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* asks for your *Anmeldung*. The lease and the *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]* are not always enough.[^14]

You don't need to register your address to...

- **Start working**  
    Your employer can't require an *Anmeldung*.[^17] They need your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) as soon as possible, but you can start working without it. You can also [get a tax ID without an *Anmeldung*](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#how-to-get-your-tax-id).
- **Open a bank account**  
    Some banks ask for a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung), but there are [expat-friendly banks](/guides/german-banks-no-address) that don't need an *Anmeldung*.

### People who don't need to register

You do not need to register if...

- **You visit for less than 3 months**  
    If you visit from another country, and you stay in Germany for less than 3 months, you don't need to register your address.[^35]
- or **you will move in the next 6 months**  
    If you are already registered somewhere else, and you will stay at your new address for less than 6 month.[^35] For example, if you are registered at your parents' house, and you live with a friend for a few months.

## How to register your address

### 1. Get a [[Bürgeramt]] appointment

You must do your *Anmeldung* **in person at the [[Bürgeramt]]**. You can go to any *[[Bürgeramt]]* in Berlin. **You need an appointment**. It must be after your move-in date.[^1] You have 14 days to register, but in Berlin nobody cares. You can do it months later.[^20]

{% include "_blocks/appointmentFinder.html" %}

**[Other ways to get an appointment ➞](/guides/berlin-burgeramt-appointment)**

**If you can't find an appointment**, try again later. New appointments appear during working hours, mostly in the morning.[^2]

You can register **multiple people with one appointment** if you lived together and move together. For example, you can do the *Anmeldung* for your whole family at the same time.

You will get an appointment number (*Vorgangsnummer*). You need it when you go to your appointment. If you lose it, ask for it at the *Bürgeramt* reception, or call [115](/glossary/B%C3%BCrgertelefon).[^28]

### 2. Prepare your documents

Bring these documents to your appointment:

- [ ] **[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]**  
    You get it before you [move in](/guides/moving-in). You can't register your address without it.[^3] Bring the original if you can, not a copy.[^4] You can get this document from...
    - Your landlord
    - The [main tenant](/glossary/Hauptmieter) of your sublet or [[WG]]. They need permission from the landlord.[^5]
    - Your spouse if you move in with them.
    - Your boyfriend or girlfriend if you move in with them. They need permission from the landlord, but the landlord can't really refuse.[^6]
- [ ] **Anmeldung form**  
    [Fill the form online](/docs/anmeldung#fill-the-anmeldung-form-online), print it and sign it. To register more than 2 people, use multiple forms.
- [ ] **Passport or EU national ID**  
    You can use a *[[Personalausweis]]* from any [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country.[^7]

You might also need these documents:

- [ ] **[Residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    If you have a residence permit, bring it. Your residence permit has your old address on it. They will put a sticker on it with your new address.[^8] That sticker is not important.[^16]
- [ ] **Vehicle registration papers**  
    If you have a vehicle, and it's registered at your old address, bring your [*Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil 1*](/glossary/Zulassungsbescheinigung). They will put a sticker on it with your new address. It costs {{VEHICLE_UMMELDUNG_FEE|cur}}€ per vehicle.
- [ ] **Cash** or a **[[Girocard]]**  
    The *Anmeldung* costs nothing, but if you have vehicles, it costs {{VEHICLE_UMMELDUNG_FEE|cur}}€ per vehicle. You can only pay with cash or a *Girocard*. Some *Bürgeramt* locations accept Visa and Mastercard.[^9]

If this is your first *Anmeldung*, you must also bring:

- [ ] **Your marriage certificate**  
    Bring the original or a notarized copy.[^10] If it's not in German, you might need a [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung).[^36] Certificates in English are usually accepted.

When you register an underage child's address, you might need a letter of consent from their legal guardian.[^11]

- [ ] **[Letter of consent](https://www.berlin.de/formularverzeichnis/?formular=/labo/zentrale-einwohnerangelegenheiten/_assets/20190125_einverstaendniserklaerung_der_sorgeberechtigten.pdf) from the legal guardians** (*Einverständniserklärung*)
    - If you are separated, and your child is moving with you, you need a letter of consent from the other parent. For example, if the child lived with their mother, and is moving with their father.
    - If the child does not live with their legal guardian, you need a letter of consent from their legal guardian.
- [ ] **Your child's birth certificate**[^37]  
    Bring the original or a notarized copy.[^10] If it's not in German, you might need a [certified translation](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung).[^38] Certificates in English are usually accepted.

**If you don't speak German**, bring a friend or a translator. Some *Bürgeramt* employees only speak German. The *Anmeldung* is simple, so will probably be okay, but sometimes they ask more questions.

**[Hire a translator ➞](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter)**

You can also **send someone else**. They will book your appointment, collect your documents, and go to the *Bürgeramt* for you. It costs 250€. The *Anmeldung* is easy. You probably don't need this service.

**[Pay someone to do your Anmeldung ➞](/out/red-tape-translation-anmeldung)**

When you send someone else to do your *Anmeldung*, they must bring:

- [ ] **A signed [[Vollmacht]]**  
    Use [this template](/documents/Anmeldung-Vollmacht-template.pdf). The signatures on your passport, on the [*Anmeldung* form](/docs/anmeldung) and on the *[[Vollmacht]]* must look the same.

### 3. Go to your Bürgeramt appointment

Go to your *Bürgeramt* appointment. Bring all your documents. Arrive early.

At the *Bürgeramt*, find the correct waiting room. When they call your number on the screen, go to the office number on the screen.

Sit at the desk, give your documents, and get your *[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*. They will put a sticker with your new address on your *[[Personalausweis]]*, [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) and [vehicle registration papers](/glossary/Zulassungsbescheinigung). That sticker is not important.[^16]

The appointment takes 5 to 15 minutes.

![Meldebestätigung](/images/Meldebescheinigung_Berlin.jpg "You get a registration certificate (Meldebestätigung)")

### 4. Verify your documents

Check the information on your *[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*. Bürgeramt employees often make mistakes.[^12] If you find an error, [email the Bürgeramt](/guides/berlin-burgeramt-appointment#how-to-contact-the-burgeramt).

### 5. Wait for your tax ID

If this is your first *Anmeldung*, you will get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) by post 2 to 5 weeks later.[^13] You can also [get a tax ID without registering your address](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#where-to-find-your-tax-id).

**If you did not get your tax ID** after 2 months, [ask for it again](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#where-to-find-your-tax-id). It happens to a lot of people.

![German tax ID letter](/images/tax-id-document-bzst.jpg "You will get your tax ID by post. The letter looks like this.")

## If you can't register your address

When you [look for an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), check if they let you do your *Anmeldung*. Some places don't give you a *[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*, and don't let you register your address. This is usually illegal, but you can rarely fight it. **Find another place.**

[Homelike](/out/homelike), [HousingAnywhere](/out/housinganywhere) and [Wunderflats](/out/wunderflats) show you if you can register your address. Those furnished apartments are very expensive, but they let you [move in](/guides/moving-in) and focus on other problems. That gives you more time to find a better, cheaper apartment.

### Can the landlord refuse to let me register?

**No**. The landlord must let you register your address, but there are exceptions:

- **You don't have permission to live there**  
    For example, someone sublets their apartment to you, but they don't have permission from their landlord. If the landlord learns this, they can kick you out with a 3 month notice.[^44]
- **It's a commercial accommodation**  
    The rules are different for hotels and commercial apartments.[^34] Some hotels and Airbnb apartments don't let you register.
    - **If you are already registered in Germany**  
        If you live there for more than 6 months, the accommodation must let you register.[^18]
    - **If you are not registered in Germany**  
        If you live there for more than 3 months, the accommodation must let you register.[^19]

The landlord can refuse to let someone sublet their apartment. There are exceptions:

- **Spouse, parents and children**  
    They do not need the landlord's permission to move in.[^42]
- **Boyfriends, girlfriends and life partners**  
    They need the landlord's permission to move in.[^41] The landlord can't refuse without a good reason.[^47] For example, because the apartment is too small.
- **Guests and visitors**  
    You have the right to have guests.[^40] Your landlord can't forbid guests. Your guests can't register their address at your apartment, because they don't live there.
- **Legitimate interest**  
    You can rent part of your apartment if there is a legitimate interest. The landlord needs a good reason to refuse. Examples of legitimate interest:
    - To replace a room mate who moved out[^46]
    - To rent your apartment while you work or study in another country[^45]
    - Because you really need the money[^43]

If you have questions, talk to a [tenant association](/glossary/Mieterverein), or use your [legal insurance](/guides/legal-insurance) to talk to a lawyer.

## If your name is not on your mailbox

German apartment buildings rarely have individual door numbers. You have the same address as everyone in your building. [If your name is not on your mailbox](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox), you won't get mail addressed to you.[^23] **You must add "c/o" or "bei" to your address**. Write your address like this:

> [your name]  
> **bei [name of person on the mailbox]**  
> Musterstraße 123  
> 10115 Berlin

When do your *Anmeldung*, add "c/o" or "bei" to your registered address.[^24] My [Anmeldung form filler](/docs/anmeldung) helps you do it. The name on the mailbox must be a real person, not a business.[^25]

If your name is not on the lease, your landlord can refuse to put your name on the mailbox.[^32] This often happens with temporary apartments.

## Questions and answers

### Do I need to deregister my old address?

**No**, you only need to do [deregister](/glossary/Abmeldung) when you leave Germany. If you just change your address, your old address is deregistered automatically.

**[Who needs to deregister? ➞](/guides/abmeldung-deregister-in-berlin#who-needs-to-deregister)**

### Do I need to speak German?

**Maybe.** Some *[[Bürgeramt]]* employees speak English, but many don't. You should bring a translator or a friend who speaks German.

The *Anmeldung* is easy, but the *Bürgeramt* employee can ask you a few questions in German. For example, which floor you live on, or how many people live with you.

Translators like [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter) can go to the *Bürgeramt* with you.

### Do I have to pay [church tax](/glossary/Kirchensteuer)?

**It depends.** When you register for the first time, they ask you what your religion is. Depending on your answer, you might start paying [church tax](/glossary/Kirchensteuer).

Church tax is 8% or 9% of your [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) (not 8-9% of your income).[^26] It's taken directly from your paycheck. A single person earning 50,000€ a year would pay 800 to 900€ per year in church tax.[^26]

**[Calculate your church tax ➞](/tools/tax-calculator)**

If you were baptised in your home country, they might collect church tax [even if you register as an atheist](http://web.archive.org/web/20180913195533/https://global.handelsblatt.com/politics/expats-beware-germany-church-tax-922429). Watch your paychecks for unexpected church tax payments.

**[How to stop paying church tax](https://www.settle-in-berlin.com/stop-paying-german-church-tax/)** - Settle in Berlin

### How much does the Anmeldung cost?

**It's free.** If you must update your vehicle registration papers, you must pay {{VEHICLE_UMMELDUNG_FEE|cur}}€ per vehicle. You can only pay with cash or with a *Girokarte*. Some *Bürgeramt* locations accept Visa and Mastercard.[^9]

### How many people can register at the same address?

In Berlin, every person needs 9 m^2^. Children up to 6 years old need 6 m^2^. For example, 10 people can register in a 90 m^2^ apartment. Two adults and a 5 year old child need at least 24 m^2^.[^27]

## What to do next

### Change your address

You must tell everyone about your new address. When you register your address, the *Bürgeramt* tells some people, but not everyone.

**[How to change your address ➞](/guides/address-change)**

### Other steps

When you register your address, the *Bürgeramt* tells the *[[ARD ZDF Deutschlandradio Beitragsservice]]*. They will collect the [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag) at your new address.

**[What is the TV tax? ➞](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag)**

You should get [liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) for your new apartment. After health insurance, it's the second most important insurance. Most Germans have it.

**[How to choose liability insurance ➞](/guides/haftpflichtversicherung)**

When you move into an apartment, you must do a few things: lower your rent, get your name on your mailbox, deduct your moving costs, and more.
