In Berlin, you can take educational leave. You get a paid vacation to improve your education. It's called *Bildungsurlaub* or *Bildungszeit*.

## What the Bildungsurlaub is for

You can use a *Bildungsurlaub* to take courses or attend seminars and training events. The training should be related to your job, or at least indirectly benefit your employer.[^11]

## How long is a Bildungsurlaub?

If you work full-time, you get **5 days of paid educational leave per year**. If you are under 26 years old, you get 10 days. If you work part time, you get less.[^1]

You can combine this year and next year's allowance, and get 10 days of educational leave. For example, you can use your allowance for {{ now.year }} and {{ now.year + 1 }}, and get 10 days off.[^4]

Educational leave does not accumulate. If you don't use it, you lose it.[^5]

You get educational leave in addition to [vacations days](/guides/vacation-days) and [public holidays](/guides/public-holidays). If you are sick during your *Bildungsurlaub*, it counts as normal [sick days](/guides/sick-leave), and you get your *Bildungsurlaub* days back.[^3]

## Bildungsurlaub requirements

All employees can get educational leave, including interns and trainees.[^10]

To get educational leave, you must...

- [ ] Work for the same employer for at least 6 months.[^6]
- [ ] Apply at least 6 weeks before your leave.[^7]
- [ ] Take at least 1 day of educational leave.
- [ ] Take a [recognised course](https://www.berlin.de/sen/arbeit/weiterbildung/bildungszeit/suche/) in a public school, a community college (*[[Volkshochschule]]*), a public university (*Hochschule*), or a recognised private school. In Berlin, many private language schools are recognised.[^9]

If your course is not recognised, you must [ask for permission](https://bildungszeit.berlin.de/veranstalter/). For example, you need permission to take a language trip in another country.

**Educational leave is a right.** Your employer must allow it, but there are times exceptions. Your employer can refuse your educational leave if...
