You can use your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) as an eID, but this feature is not activated. This guide explains how to activate it.

## How the eID works

German ID cards have a chip in them. You can use your ID card and the [AusweisApp](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/home) to log into online government services. This is feature is called *Online-Ausweisfunktion*, *eID*, *elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel* or *eAT*.

## Why you should activate your eID

**To use online government services**.[^1] Some services require an eID:

- Applying for [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I) if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job)
- Registering a vehicle after you [buy it](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany)
- [Requesting a replacement](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung) of your [registration certificate](/glossary/Meldebescheinigung)

In Berlin, most services are not digital, or they don't require an eID.

If you don't have eID, you must do everything in person. It's slower.

## How to activate your eID

### 1. Check if your eID is activated

Download the [AusweisApp](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/home), and use your phone to scan your residence permit. The app will tell you if your eID already works.

If you received your residence permit by mail, the eID is not activated. If you picked it up at the *Ausländerbehörde*, it's sometimes activated.[^4] Ask them to activate it when you pick up the residence permit.

After you apply for your residence permit, you will get a letter with a PIN for your eID. It arrives 2 weeks before your new residence permit.[^3]

### 2. Activate your eID

After you receive your residence permit, you can activate the eID function at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*:[^2]

1. [Contact the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment). There is no form or appointment category for this; you must use the general contact form. You can't activate your residence permit at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*.
2. Receive an appointment at the Ausländerbehörde.
3. Go to your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment. The appointment only takes a few minutes.

If you pick up your residence permit at the *Ausländerbehörde*, ask if they can activate the eID function while you are there.
