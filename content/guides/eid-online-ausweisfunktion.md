You can use your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) as an [[eID]]. This allows you to log into online government services. This feature is not always activated. This guide explains how to activate it.

## How the eID works

German ID cards have a chip in them. You can use your ID card and the [AusweisApp](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/home) to log into online government services. This is feature is called *Online-Ausweisfunktion*, *eID*, *elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel* or *eAT*.

## Why you should activate your eID

**To use online government services**.[^1] Some services require an eID:

- Applying for [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I) if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job)
- Apply for *[[Kindergeld]]*[^5]
- Registering a vehicle after you [buy it](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany)
- [Requesting a replacement](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung) of your [registration certificate](/glossary/Meldebescheinigung)

In Berlin, most services are not digital, or they don't require an eID. Most new digital services require an eID.

If you don't have eID, you must do everything in person. It's slower.

## How to activate your eID

### 1. Check if it's activated

Some residence permits come with the eID feature already activated.[^4] Usually, if they mailed the residence permit to you, the eID feature is not activated. If you picked it up at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, it's probably activated.

**[Download the AusweisApp](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/home)**, and use your phone to scan your residence permit. The app will tell you if your eID already works.

### 2. Activate your eID

After you receive your residence permit, you can activate the eID function at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.[^2] Cards issued by the *[[Bürgeramt]]* can be [activated at the *Bürgeramt*](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/329830/standort/122274/). Cards issued by the *Ausländerbehörde* must be activated at the *Ausländerbehörde*.

To activate your eID at the *Ausländerbehörde*:

1. [Contact the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment). There is no form or appointment category for this; you must use the general contact form. **You can't activate your residence permit at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*.**[^6]
2. Wait to receive an appointment date. This can take a long time.
3. Go to your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment. The appointment only takes a few minutes.

If you can activate your eID at the *Bürgeramt*, you might not need an appointment. For example, you don't need an appointment [in Steglitz](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/329830/standort/122274/#:~:text=dienstleistungen%20ohne%20termin).

If you pick up a new residence permit at the *Ausländerbehörde*, ask if they can activate the eID function while you are there.
