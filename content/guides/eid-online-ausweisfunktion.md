German ID cards have a chip in them. You can use your ID card and the [AusweisApp2](https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/home) to log into online government services. This is feature is called *Online-Ausweisfunktion*, *eID*, *elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel* or *eAT*.

Your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) has this function, but it's not activated. This guide explains how to activate it.

## Why you should activate your eID

**To use online government services**.[^1] It helps you do things online, instead of going in person. For example, you can apply for [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I) online if you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job).

In Berlin, almost no other services use the eID.

## How to activate your eID

After you apply for your residence permit, you will get a letter with a PIN for your eID. It arrives 2 weeks before your new residence permit.

After you receive your residence permit, you must activate the eID function at the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*:[^2]

1. [Contact the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment). There is no form or appointment category for this; you must use the general contact form. You can't activate your residence permit at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*.
2. Receive an appointment at the Ausländerbehörde.
3. Go to your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment. The appointment only takes a few minutes.
