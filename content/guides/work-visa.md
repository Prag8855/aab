    If the job requires a permit or special qualifications, you must have them.[^12] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need permits or specific qualifications.

## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a work visa **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a work visa at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. You must apply at the *Ausländerbehörde* where you live. You can't apply in another city.

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).

Usually, you can't work before you get your work visa.[^35] It can take time. You might wait a few months with no income. It's cheaper and safer if you [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).

An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can help you apply for a work visa. They take care of everything. It's much easier for you. It costs 500 to 2,000€.[^45]

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and [look for a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for a job, and apply for the work visa in Germany.[^9] You can't work before you get your work visa.
- **If you have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    Your current residence permit stays valid until you get your work visa. [If your residence permit expires](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon) while you wait, you don't need to leave Germany.
- **If you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)**  
    You can come to Germany and look for a job. When you find a job, you can apply for the work visa. While you wait for your work visa, you can work 10 hours per week for your new employer.[^11]
- **If you have a [tourist visa](/glossary/Schengen%20visa)**  
    You can't apply for a work visa with a tourist visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you must [apply for the work visa in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-home-country).[^19]

### 2. Find a job

You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply for the work visa.[^15] Your job offer must meet the [work visa requirements](#work-visa-requirements).

**[How to find a job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

### 3. Prepare your work visa application

Before you apply for the work visa, you must...

- [ ] **Find a place to live**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be [big enough](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#how-many-people-can-register-at-one-address).
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your rent can't be higher than your income.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). You must get a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) from your landlord. If you can't get this, you might not get a work visa.[^1] - [How to find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Get health insurance**  
    You need valid health insurance. Travel insurance is not accepted. [Talk to a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers). They will help you choose health insurance for your work visa application. Their help is free. - [How to choose health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance)
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents](#required-documents) ↓**

While you wait, you should also...

- [ ] **Register your address** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). Your employer needs your tax ID when you start working. You might need a registration certificate to [open a bank account](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany), get a SIM card, find a [[Kita]] for your children, and use government services. - [How to register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)
- [ ] **Open a bank account**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your work visa application fee, and get paid by your employer. You can choose a bank from any EU country. - [How to choose a bank](/guides/first-bank-account-in-germany)

### 4. Apply for the work visa

There are 2 ways to apply for the work visa in Berlin:

- **Apply in person**  
    [Get an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment), go to your appointment, give your documents, and wait for your residence permit. It's almost impossible to get an appointment.
- or **send your documents online**  
    Use the [*Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/out/auslanderbehorde-contact) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents), and wait for them to contact you. A few weeks later, they will give you an appointment. Most of the time, this is your only option.

??? What appointment type to book ???

### 5. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application. It takes 1 week and 5 months to get an appointment. After the appointment, it takes {{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} to get your work visa.

If you already have a residence permit, it stays valid until the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* makes a decision. The conditions of your current residence permit apply until you get your new work visa.

**[If your residence permit expires soon ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-your-visa-expires-soon)**

If you wait more than 3 months, you can [sue the *Ausländerbehörde* for inaction](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#if-you-dont-get-an-answer).[^20]

### 6. Go to your work visa appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you an appointment invitation.

When you go to your appointment, bring...[^7]

- [ ] **Your appointment confirmation**  
    If you can't prove that you have an appointment, you can't enter the *Ausländerbehörde*. They check this document at the door.
- [ ] **1 biometric photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. The photo should be less than 6 months old.[^36] - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)
- [ ] **A translator** (optional)  
    Many *Ausländerbehörde* employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring an interpreter or a German-speaking friend. It's not required, but it helps. If you need an interpreter, I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter).
- [ ] **The [required documents ↓](#required-documents)**  
    If you did not send your application online, bring all your application documents.

The appointment takes around 15 minutes. During the appointment, they take your fingerprints for your work visa.

**[Going to the Ausländerbehörde ➞](/guides/berlin-auslanderbehorde-appointment#during-your-appointment)**

### 7. Get your work visa

{{ RESIDENCE_PERMIT_WAIT_TIME }} after your *Ausländerbehörde* appointment,[^22] you get 2 letters:

1. **The eID activation code**  
    This letter arrives first. You need it to [activate the eID function](#activate-your-eid) of your work visa.
2. **Your work visa**  
    Around 2 weeks later, you receive your work visa, or an invitation to collect your work visa at the *Ausländerbehörde*.[^28]

Your work visa is a plastic card. The expiration date is written on the card. It's usually **valid for 3 years**.[^17] If you have a limited work contract, your work visa is valid for a shorter time. For example, if you have a 2 year work contract, your work visa is valid for 2 years + 3 months.[^3]

Check if the information on your work visa is correct. The *Ausländerbehörde* sometimes makes mistakes.

### 8. Start working in Germany
