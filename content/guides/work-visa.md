- Become a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 2 to 3 years[^10]
- Become a citizen after 5 years

## Who needs a work visa?

If you are not a citizen of the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), [[EEA]] or Switzerland, you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live in Germany. The work visa is a type of residence permit.

If you are a [permanent resident](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you don't need a work visa. You can already work anywhere.

**[Who needs a residence permit? ➞](/guides/residence-permit#who-needs-a-residence-permit)**

## Work visa requirements

To get a work visa, you need...[^18]

- [ ] **A guaranteed job offer**  
    You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply for the work visa.[^15] It can be a short-term or part-time job. It can be a remote job. You must be an employee, not a freelancer.
- [ ] **A fair salary**  
    There is no minimum salary, but you can't be underpaid.[^42] You must earn as much as Germans who have a similar job.[^32] - [Compare your salary](/guides/salaries-in-germany)
- [ ] **Qualifications for this job**  
    You must know how to do your job. For example, to get a car mechanic job, you must know how to fix cars. Your job can be unrelated to your education.[^31]
- [ ] **Permission to do this job**  
    You must have all the permits and special qualifications needed for the job.[^12] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need special qualifications. - [Find the requirements for your job](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)

If you are **not** a citizen of {{ BESCHV_26_COUNTRIES }}, you must have...[^38]

- [ ] **Vocational training** or a **university degree**  
    You must be trained to do this job. Your education or training must be [recognised by the *Agentur für Arbeit*](/guides/residence-permit#get-your-education-recognised). It must be equivalent to 2 years of training in Germany. If you have a university degree, try to get a [[Blue Card]]; it's better. Your job can be unrelated to your education.[^31]

If you are **not** a citizen of {{ BESCHV_26_1_COUNTRIES }}, you must have...[^49]

- [ ] **An employer in Germany**  
    Your employer must have an office in Germany, even it it's a remote job.[^30]

If you are over 45 years old, you must have...[^43]

- [ ] A [net salary](/glossary/Netto%20income) of at least {{ WORK_VISA_MIN_INCOME|cur }}€ per year
- [ ] **or** a pension plan that guarantees an income after retirement {# Give exact amount #}

**You do not need to speak German** to get a work visa.[^27]

If you can't get a work visa, there are [other residence permits](/guides/residence-permit#for-work) that let you work in Germany.

**[Work visa alternatives ➞](/guides/residence-permit#for-work)**

## How to apply in Berlin

You can apply for a work visa **after you move to Germany**:

1. Come to Germany
2. Apply for a work visa at your local *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. If you don't live in Berlin, [find your local *Ausländerbehörde*](https://bamf-navi.bamf.de/de/Themen/Behoerden/) and apply there.
3. Get your work visa
4. Start working

You can apply in Germany if...

- You are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}[^9]
- **or** you already have a German [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and you want to change it or renew it
- **or** you have an [EU Permanent Residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence) in another country
- **or** you have an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)
- **or** you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)[^41]
- **or** you have a [[National Visa]] that you must [convert to a work visa](/guides/residence-permit#convert-your-national-visa).

If you can't apply in Germany, you must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).

Usually, you can't work while you wait for your work visa.[^35] You might wait [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) with no income. It's cheaper and safer if you [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country), then come to Germany when you have permission to work.

**Need help?** An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can take care of everything. It costs 500 to 2,000€.[^45] Your employer might pay for it, or hire someone to help you.

### 1. Come to Germany

[Come to Germany](/guides/visit-berlin#how-to-travel-to-berlin) and [look for a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin).

- **If you have a [[National Visa]] or [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    [If your current visa or residence permit expires](/guides/residence-permit#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires) after you applied for the work visa, you don't need to leave Germany. It stays valid until you get your work visa.
- **If you are a citizen of {{AUFENTHV_41_COUNTRIES}}**  
    You can come to Germany without a visa. You can stay 90 days in Germany without a residence permit. You can look for a job, and apply for the work visa in Germany.[^9] You can't work before you get your work visa.
- **If you have an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte)**  
    You can come to Germany and look for a job. You can work 20 hours per week. To work full time, you must get a Blue Card or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa).
- **If you have a [job seeker visa](/glossary/Job%20seeker%20visa)**  
    You can come to Germany and look for a job. To start working, you must get a Blue Card or a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa).[^11]
- **If you have a [[Schengen visa]]**  
    Schengen visas are for tourism, not immigration. You can't apply for a work visa with a Schengen visa. Your application will be rejected. You must [apply in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^25]

If these options don't apply to you, you must [apply for the work visa in your home country](#how-to-apply-in-your-country).[^19]

### 2. Find a job

You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply for the work visa.[^15] Your job offer must meet the [work visa requirements](#work-visa-requirements).

**[How to find a job ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin)**

### 3. Prepare your application

Before you apply for the work visa...

- [ ] **[Find a place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin)**  
    It's really hard to find an apartment. Start looking as soon as you can.
    - [ ] You must be allowed to [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). Your landlord must give you a [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung). If you can't get a tenancy confirmation, you might not get a work visa.[^1]
    - [ ] Your apartment must be affordable. Your total cost of living must be less than your income.
    - [ ] Your apartment must be big enough. You need 9 m^2^ per adult, and 6 m^2^ per child.[^54]
- [ ] **[Get health insurance](/guides/german-visa-health-insurance#for-a-work-visa-or-blue-card)**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose the correct health insurance.
- [ ] **Prepare the [required documents ➞](#required-documents)**

If you are **not** a citizen of {{ BESCHV_26_COUNTRIES }}, you must also...

- [ ] **Get your education recognised**  
    Your professional training must be equivalent to 2 years of professional training in Germany. It must be recognised by the *[[Agentur für Arbeit]]*. The recognition process depends on your profession.[^21] It can take a few months.[^8] If you studied in Germany, your education is already recognised. - [How to get your education recognised](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)

If you bring your family to Germany, you can apply for their [family reunion visa](/glossary/Family%20reunion%20visa) at the same time. You must prepare their documents too.

While you wait for an *Ausländerbehörde* appointment, you should also...

- [ ] **[Register your address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin)** (*[[Anmeldung]]*)  
    [The *Anmeldung* is very important](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#why-you-must-register-your-address). When you register your address, you get a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) and a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). The *Ausländerbehörde* might ask for your registration certificate.[^53]
- [ ] **[Open a bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany)**  
    You need it to pay your rent, pay your work visa application fee, and get paid by your employer. You can choose a bank from any EU country.

### 4. Apply for the work visa

To apply in Berlin, you must [use the *Ausländerbehörde* contact form](/guides/immigration-office#how-to-contact-the-auslanderbehorde) to send all the [required documents](#required-documents) to [department B1/B2/B3/B4](/guides/immigration-office#departments).

Wait for them to contact you. [A few weeks later](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times), they will reply and give you an appointment. They might also ask for more documents.

This is the only option. You can't go to the *Ausländerbehörde* without an appointment. You only get an appointment after you send your documents through the contact form.

**[How to send your application ➞](/guides/residence-permit#send-your-application)

### 5. Wait

The *Ausländerbehörde* will process your application, then invite you for an appointment. This takes [a few weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times). There is no way to track your application. While you wait, your current [[National Visa]] or residence permit [stays valid](/guides/residence-permit#if-your-visa-or-residence-permit-expires), even if it should expire.

If you have an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte), you can work 20 hours per week while you wait for your work visa.

**[What happens while you wait ➞](/guides/residence-permit#wait)**

### 6. Go to your appointment

Later, the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* will email you. They will invite you for an appointment. Follow the instructions in the email. They might ask you to bring more documents.

**[What happens during your appointment ➞](/guides/residence-permit#go-to-your-appointment)**

If your work visa is approved, you will get a second appointment to pick up your plastic residence card. While you wait, **you can start working**. You will get a document that confirms this.[^4]

### 7. Get your work visa

Go to your second *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointment and pick up your work visa. Your new work visa is valid for up to 4 years.[^17] If you have a limited work contract, your work visa is valid for a shorter time. For example, if you have a 2 year work contract, your work visa is valid for 2 years + 3 months.[^3]

**[How to pick up your work visa ➞](/guides/residence-permit#pick-up-your-residence-card)**

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/workVisa.html" %}

### 8. Start working in Germany

**[Starting a new job in Germany ➞](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin#start-working)**

**[Your first month in Germany ➞](/guides/moving-to-berlin#your-first-month-in-berlin)**

## How to apply in your country

You can also apply for a work visa in your country, then move to Germany. This is **cheaper and safer**, because when you arrive in Germany, you can already start working. You don't need to wait in Germany without an income.

You must [find a job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin) before you apply.[^15] Your job offer must meet the [work visa requirements](#work-visa-requirements). If you don't have a job offer, you can get an [opportunity card](/glossary/Chancenkarte), come to Germany, find a job, then apply for a work visa in Germany.

**To get a work visa faster**, use the [fast-track procedure](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/looking-for-foreign-professionals/entering/the-fast-track-procedure-for-skilled-workers) (*Beschleunigtes Verfahren*). It costs {{FAST_TRACK_FEE|cur}}€.

**[How to apply in your country ➞](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-apply-in-your-country)**

## Required documents

These are the required documents **in Berlin**.[^2] If you apply elsewhere, they require different documents. Check the website of the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*, embassy or consulate where you apply. - [Find your embassy or consulate](/out/consulate-finder)

- [ ] **Passport**  
    When you [apply online](#apply-for-the-work-visa), include a colour scan of your passport. When you [go to your appointment](#go-to-your-appointment), bring your original passport. You get it back during the appointment; they do not keep it.
- [ ] **Passport photo** (35 × 45 mm)  
    The photo should be under 6 months old.[^36] You do not need to cut the photos yourself; they have a tool for this. - [Where to get passport photos](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)
- [ ] **Job contract** or **job offer**  
    Bring the original, not a copy.
- [ ] **[Residence permit application form](/docs/residence-permit-application-form)** (*Antrag auf Erteilung eines Aufenthaltstitels*)  
    Download the form [here](/docs/residence-permit-application-form) or [on Berlin.de](https://www.berlin.de/formularverzeichnis/?formular=/labo/zuwanderung/_assets/lea-agen1-antrag_engl_frz_ital-112021.pdf).
- [ ] **[Job description form](/documents/erklaerung-zum-beschaeftigungsverhaeltnis-2024.pdf)** (*Erklärung zum Beschäftigungsverhältnis*)  
    Your employer should fill this form and sign it. Download the form [here](/documents/erklaerung-zum-beschaeftigungsverhaeltnis-2024.pdf) or [on Berlin.de](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/_assets/stellenbeschreibung.pdf).
- [ ] **Proof of health insurance**  
    You need valid [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Travel insurance is not accepted. [Ask a health insurance broker](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you choose health insurance.
    - [ ] **Health insurance card**
    - [ ] or **proof of public health insurance**  
        Get a *[Mitgliedsbescheinigung nach 175 SGB V](/images/krankenkasse-mitgliedsbescheinigung-nach-175-sgb-v.png)* from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.
    - [ ] or **proof of private health insurance**  
        Bring your insurance contract, a *Mitgliedsbescheinigung*, and bank statements that show health insurance payments. Get these documents from your health insurer or your health insurance broker.[^6]
- [ ] **Proof of housing**  
    You need a [place to live](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) where you can [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung).  If you apply in Berlin, your home address must be in Berlin.
    - [ ] **Lease**  
        It must show the size of your apartment. Your apartment must be big enough (9 m^2^ per adult, 6 m^2^ per child).[^54] You must make enough money to pay your rent. It can be a temporary lease, a [[WG]] or a sublet.
    - [ ] and **tenancy confirmation** (*[[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung]]*)  
        Some temporary apartments and sublets don't give you this document. You might not get a work visa without it.[^1]
    - [ ] and **registration certificate** (*[[Anmeldebestätigung]]*)  
        You must [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) to get this document. If you don't have it, your lease and [tenancy confirmation](/glossary/Wohnungsgeberbestätigung) are sometimes enough. At least bring proof that you have a [*Bürgeramt* appointment](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin#get-a-burgeramt-appointment).[^5]
- [ ] **Occupation practice permit** (*Berufsausübungserlaubnis*)  
    You must have all the permits and special qualifications needed for the job.[^12] For example, doctors, engineers and lawyers need special qualifications. - [Find the requirements for your job](https://www.anerkennung-in-deutschland.de/en/interest/finder/profession)
- [ ] **Translations**  
    If your documents are not in German, bring translations. For certificates and official documents, bring [certified translations](/glossary/beglaubigte%20Übersetzung). They *sometimes* accept untranslated documents, but don't take the risk. Get translations from [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-certified) or [Lingoking](/out/lingoking).

If you are **not** a citizen of {{ BESCHV_26_COUNTRIES }}, you also need...

- [ ] **Proof of vocational training**  
    A certificate or a degree that proves that you received professional training to do this job.
- [ ] **Certificate of equivalence**  
    Proof that your professional training is recognised in Germany. If you got professional training in Germany, you don't need this.[^50]

When you [send your application](#apply-for-the-work-visa), **use PDF files or photos.** Don't use word documents or other file formats.[^37] If you have too many documents, [merge them](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/merge-pdf.html) or [make them smaller](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html). You can also [mail your documents](/guides/mail-a-letter), but it's not better or faster.

When you [go to to your appointment](#go-to-your-appointment), print everything. Use A4 paper. Do not staple the pages together. Some case workers also ask for documents that you already sent. It's safer if you bring everything you have, including documents that you already sent.

## After you get your work visa

**[What to do after you get your residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit#after-you-get-your-permit)**

### Give feedback

Tell me how long it took to get your work visa. Your feedback helps thousands of people plan their application.

{% include "_blocks/feedbackResidencePermit/workVisa.html" %}

**[See other people's feedback ➞](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times)**

### If you change or lose your job

When you change jobs, always [tell the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/losing-your-job#tell-the-auslanderbehorde). You might need their permission to work for a different employer.

If you [lose your job](/guides/losing-your-job), your work visa stays valid. [Tell the *Ausländerbehörde*](/guides/losing-your-job#tell-the-auslanderbehorde) as soon as you can. In Berlin, they give you 6 months to find another job. While you are unemployed, you can get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I).

**[What happens to your work visa ➞](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-residence-permit)**

### Travel with a work visa

Your work visa lets you visit other [[Schengen area]] countries without a visa. You can travel outside of Germany for up to 6 months.[^23] If you travel longer, your work visa expires.

**[Travel with a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit#if-you-travel)**

### Self-employment with a work visa

Your work visa might allow part-time self-employment. [Check your *Zusatzblatt*](/guides/zusatzblatt) to see if it's allowed.

Check your work contract too. You might need to tell your employer about your self-employment. Your employer might forbid self-employment if it competes with their business. For example, don't start a marketing agency while you work for another marketing agency. They can't forbid all self-employment without a reason.[^16]

To become self-employed full time, [apply for a freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa#who-needs-a-freelance-visa), [permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence) or citizenship.

### Apply for permanent residence

If you have a work visa, you qualify for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) after 24 to 60 months. Permanent residence is better than a work visa, because it's not tied to your job.

**[How to apply for permanent residence ➞](/guides/permanent-residence)**

## Need help?

An [immigration lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin) or a [relocation consultant](/guides/relocation-agency-in-berlin) can answer your questions. Some organisations can also help you for free.
