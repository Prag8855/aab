## Before your job search

### Can you work in Germany?

If you are not a citizen of the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), [[EEA]] or Switzerland, you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to work in Germany. You can get a [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) or a [[Blue Card]], for example. There might be a minimum salary or education requirement.

## 2. Apply for jobs

### German resumes

German CVs are longer than American resumes. They include your date of birth, your citizenship and a photo of you.[^0] You should go to a photo studio and get a professional portrait for your resume. A [career coach](#need-help) can help you write a better resume.

### Cover letters

Include a short cover letter (*Anschreiben*) with your application. It's a personal introduction. It explains who you are, what you do, why you apply for this job, and why they should hire you.

Don't send the same cover letter to everyone. Do your research, and personalise the letter for each job offer. Keep it short and easy to read. Get feedback from other people before you send it. A [career coach](#need-help) can help you write better cover letters.

## 3. The job interview

In Germany, the interview process is very long. It can take a few weeks, and even a few months. You might have multiple interviews with different people. It depends on the company and the job. You need a lot of time for this.

### The phone screen

The interview process starts with a short call. A recruiter or hiring manager will ask you a few questions. They will try to understand who you are, what you want, and how you fit the job offer. It's a simple check before they invite you for an interview.

**[How to prepare](https://medium.com/imagine-foundation/dating-for-job-seekers-c23a23460656)** - Imagine Foundation

### The technical interview

Most tech companies have technical interviews or coding challenges. They verify that you know how to do your job.

Technical interviews are different at every company. They might ask you technical questions, ask you to solve a problem during the interview, or complete a technical challenge at home. Some companies don't have technical interviews.

### Meet the team

Most companies have a team interview. You meet your future team to see if you work well together. This interview is more relaxed. You might just talk with the team, or have lunch together.

## 4. The job offer

After your interview, the company can make a job offer.

### Salary negotiation

After you get the job offer, you can negotiate a better salary. You can also ask for things like a relocation bonus or more [vacation days](/guides/vacation-days).

**[Salaries in Germany ➞](/guides/salaries-in-germany)**

### The job contract

Read your job contract carefully. If your employer promised something to you during the interview, verify that it's in your contract. Only sign the contract if you agree with everything. Send the signed contract by email or [by post](/guides/mail-a-letter).

If you are not sure about your contract, [ask for help](/guides/questions-about-berlin#legal-questions) or [talk to a lawyer](/guides/english-speaking-lawyers-berlin).

## 5. Get a residence permit

If you are not a citizen of the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), [[EEA]] or Switzerland, you need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) to live in Germany. Sometimes, you must wait for your residence permit to start working. It can take [a few months](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times).

**[How to get a residence permit ➞](/guides/residence-permit)**

If you already have a residence permit, you might need the *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*'s permission to change jobs. Sometimes, you can start your new job immediately. Sometimes, you must wait for your new residence permit. This can take [a few weeks](/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times).

**[How to change jobs ➞](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-residence-permit)**

## 6. Start working

### Things your employer needs

**During your first month at a new company**, your employer needs a few things:

- **A [bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany)**  
    Your employer will pay you by bank transfer. For this, you need a bank account that supports [SEPA transfers](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). Any European bank account will work.
- **Your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer)** (*Steueridentifikationsnummer*)  
    You get a tax ID when you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) for the first time. If you can't register your address, you can still get a tax ID. If you can't get a tax ID, you can still start working. - [More information](/guides/german-tax-id-steuernummer#the-tax-id-steuer-id)
- **Your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung) number** (*Krankenversicherungsnummer*)  
    You get a *Krankenversicherungsnummer* 2 to 7 days after you [choose health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance). Your employer needs this number to take health insurance payments from your salary. Your employer can choose health insurance for you, but it's a bad idea. [Ask a broker to help you choose](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers), it's free.
- **Your [social insurance number](/guides/german-versicherungsnummer)** (*Sozialversicherungsnummer*)  
    If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), you get this number automatically in the mail. If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), you must apply for it. Your employer can sometimes help you with this. - [How to get a social insurance number](/guides/german-versicherungsnummer)

Your employer can't require an [address registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung).[^4]

### Things you must know

In Germany, most people are paid once per month, usually on the 1st or 15th day of the month. You get your first paycheck after 30 or 45 days after you start working. You usually get paid by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung).

Most employees in Germany are paid by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung) once per month, [on the first day of the month](/guides/salaries-in-germany#when-do-i-get-paid).[^3] Your employer takes [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer), [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung), [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung) and [unemployment insurance](/glossary/Arbeitslosenversicherung) from your paycheck. 

**[Income tax calculator ➞](/tools/tax-calculator)**

**[How taxes work ➞](/guides/taxes)**

During your first 6 months at a new company, you are in your probation period (*[[Probezeit]]*).[^1] During that time, it's easier to get fired. It's also harder to [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin), because you don't have a stable job.

**[How does the probation period work? ➞](/guides/probezeit)**

All employees in Germany get paid [vacation days](/guides/vacation-days), and paid [sick leave](/guides/sick-leave). You don't work on [public holidays](/guides/public-holidays), but you still get paid.

**[How to take vacations ➞](/guides/vacation-days)**

**[What to do when you are sick ➞](/guides/sick-leave)**

## 7. Make a tax declaration

Many of your job search costs are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar):[^2]

- **Relocation costs**  
    If you move closer to your new job, you can [deduct your moving costs](/guides/moving-in#deduct-your-moving-costs).
- **Job search costs**  
    Coaching, resume writing, professional photos, translations, printing costs, job search services...
- **Travel costs**  
    Fuel, train tickets, hotels, meals and parking fees to go to job interviews.

If you started working in the middle of the year, you probably paid too much [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer). Make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung) to lower your [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer), and get some money back.
