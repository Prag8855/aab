## What does this abbreviation mean?

German job offers often show "m/w/d" in the title. It's an abbreviation for "männlich, weiblich oder divers" - "male, female or diverse". This abbreviation means that the job offer is open to all genders, even if the job title is masculine.

### Alternative abbreviations

The abbreviation is sometimes in a different order, like "d/w/m", to avoid putting men first and diverse people last.[^0] Other letters like "a" (other), "t" (transsexual), "i" (intersexual), "gn" (gender neutral) and "x" (undefined) are sometimes used.[^1]

## Why is it everywhere?

Hiring discrimination based on gender is illegal. Companies add this information in their job offers to prevent discrimination lawsuits.[^2] It does not guarantee that the employer cares about diversity.
