In Germany, **tipping is optional**. Everyone tips differently. This guide you an idea of how people *usually* tip. The answers come from workers who receive tips.

## Tipping in restaurants

Most people tip in restaurants[^0], but it's okay if you don't. German waiters do not need tips to survive. They won't be rude if you don't tip. Tips are still a big part of their income[^1].

### Restaurants with table service

Most people **round up by 1 or 2€**[^2]. For example, if your bill is 16.30€, you give 17€ or 18€ in total. You don't have to tip more if the bill is higher.

Other people tip around 10% of your bill[^3]. For larger bills, you usually tip less - around 5%[^4].

When you pay by card, you should also leave a tip[^5]. If possible, tip in cash.

### Fast food restaurants

In fast food restaurants without table service, **you don't need to tip**. If you want, you can **round up your bill**. For example, if the bill is 5.50€, you can leave 6€[^6].

People don't tip in fast food chains like McDonalds or Burger King[^16].

### Where does your tip go?

This depends on the restaurant. Sometimes, it goes directly to your waiter. Sometimes, it's shared between waiters and kitchen staff. The restaurant owner can't keep the tip; it belongs to the staff[^7].

## Tipping in bars

## Tipping delivery drivers

### Food delivery

Tipping is optional. People often tip **0.50€ to 2€**[^8]. When the weather is really bad, people sometimes give more.

**Tip the driver directly, in cash**[^9]. When you tip in the delivery app, the money sometimes goes to the restaurant. Some restaurants don't give the tips to their drivers[^10].

### Mail and packages

People don't tip postal workers[^11]. Some people tip on Christmas or New Year, but it's not common.

## Tipping taxi drivers

...

## Tipping barbers and hairdressers

Some people tip, but it's not expected. If you are happy with your haircut, you can tip around 10%[^12].

## Tipping in hotels

People rarely leave a tip in hotel rooms. It's not expected. You can leave a few Euros in your room for the cleaning staff, if you choose to[^13].

## Other services

## How to leave a tip

### When you pay with cash

If you want to leave a tip, you say the total amount (bill + tip) when you give the money.

> **Example:** The bill is 16.30€. You say "18" and give a 20€ bill. The employee gives you 2€ back, and gets a 1.70€ tip.[^14]

If you want the waiter to keep the change, give the money and say "stimmt so".[^15]

> **Example:** The bill is 18€. You give 20€. You say "stimmt so". The employee keeps the extra 2€.

### When you pay by card

German credit card machines don't have a button for tip. When it's time to pay, you say how much you want to give (bill + tip) in advance.

> **Example:** The bill is 16.30€. You say "18" and give your card. The credit card machine charges you 18€. The waiter gets a 1.70€ tip.

You can also pay by card, but tip with cash.
