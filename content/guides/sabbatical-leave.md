Sabbatical leave is a long, unpaid vacation from work. People usually take a sabbatical to travel, study, relax, or work on personal projects.

This guide shows you how to take a sabbatical in Germany.

## Option 1: Working time account

A working time account (*Wertguthaben*) lets your employer save part of your salary while you work, and keep paying you during your sabbatical. **It's a really good deal**.

For example, your employer saves 20% of your salary for 4 years. Then you take 1 year off. During your year off, you get paid 80% of your salary. In other words, instead of getting paid 4 × 100% of your salary, you get paid 5 × 80%.

Benefits of a working time account:

- **You keep your job, your salary and your benefits**  
    You keep your job. Your employer still pays your salary, half of your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung), your [pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung) and your [unemployment insurance](/glossary/Arbeitslosenversicherung), so you save a lot of money. At the end of your sabbatical, you get your job back. You keep your salary and your seniority at this company.
- **You keep your residence permit**  
    If you quit your job, you might lose your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel). The [work visa](/glossary/Work%20Visa) and the [[Blue Card]] are tied to your job. After a few months without a job, you will need to leave Germany. With the working time account, you keep your job, so that's not a problem.
- **You pay less income tax**  
    You pay less [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) on 5 × 80% of your salary than on 4 × 100% of your salary. If you have a 50,000€ salary, you save around 5,200€ in income tax. [Calculate it yourself](/tools/tax-calculator).

Disadvantages:

- **It takes more time**  
    You must wait before you take your sabbatical. For example, you might need to save for 4 years to take 1 year off. If you want to take a sabbatical soon, this does not work.

### How to start a working time account

Talk to your HR department. They will tell you if they have such a program at your company. Each company has different rules. Most companies do not offer working time accounts.

## Option 2: Unpaid leave

The second best option is unpaid leave (*unbezahlter Urlaub*).

You have the right to take unpaid leave in some situations[^0]:

- Unexpected emergencies
- Parental leave (*Elternzeit*)
- Taking care of your children under 12 years old
- Taking care of a sick family member
- Certain volunteer activities
- If your work contract gives you the right to unpaid leave

In other situations, your employer can refuse to let you take unpaid leave[^1].

Benefits of unpaid leave:

- **You keep your job**  
    You can return to your job after your sabbatical. If you must keep your job to keep your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), this is important.

Disadvantages:

- **You lose your salary and benefits**  
    Your employer does not pay your salary or any benefits. After 1 month, you must pay for your own health insurance[^2]. You will pay the same tariff as unemployed people. [Calculate it yourself](/tools/health-insurance-calculator). If your spouse or your parents have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), they can cover you for free[^3].
- **You keep your job**  
    You are still employed with the same company. You can't start a competing business or work for the competition.

### How to take unpaid leave

1. Read your work contract. You might have the *right* to unpaid leave.
2. Look if other employees have taken unpaid leave. You have the right to the same treatment as your coworkers. If they took unpaid leave, you can do it too[^4].
3. Talk to your manager and your HR department. You must plan this together.

## Option 3: Quit your job

If your employer does not help you take a sabbatical, you can quit your job.

Disadvantages of quitting your job:

- **You must pay for your own health insurance**  
    Your employer does not pay for half of your health insurance. You pay the same tariff as unemployed people. [Calculate it yourself](/tools/health-insurance-calculator). If your spouse or your parents have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), they can cover you for free.
- **You might lose your residence permit**  
    The work visa and the Blue Card are tied to your job. After a few months without a job, you will need to leave Germany.
- **You need a job when you return**  
    After your sabbatical, you can try to get your old job back, but it's not guaranteed to work. You might need to find a new job.

## Alternatives to a sabbatical

If you want to take a short vacation, use your vacation days. All employees get vacation days.

If you need time off because of your mental health, get a [sick note](/glossary/Krankschreibung), and take sick leave.

If you want to get training for your job, take a *[[Bildungsurlaub]]*.
