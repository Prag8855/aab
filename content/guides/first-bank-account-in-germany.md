## German banks for expats

As a foreigner, it's **harder to open a bank account**. German banks don't recognise all passports. They can ask for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung).

If you need a bank account *now*, choose an expat-friendly bank. You don't need a German bank; any bank in the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) works.

### Expat-friendly banks

Most online banks are expat-friendly. They make it easy to open an account. They accept most documents, and rarely require an *[[Anmeldung]]*.

- **[N26](/out/n26)**  
    An German online bank. I use them since 2016, and [I recommend them](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26). You get 3 free ATM withdrawals per month.
    - They speak English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
    - They accept [many passport types](/out/n26-supported-passports). Some nationals need a plastic [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that's valid for at least 1 year. No *[[Anmeldung]]* needed.
- **[bunq](/out/bunq)**  
    A Dutch online bank. They accept more people than N26. You get a German [[IBAN]]. You get 6 free ATM withdrawals per month.
    - They speak English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
    - They accept [more passport types](/out/bunq-supported-passports) than N26. No [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or *[[Anmeldung]]* needed.[^55] They use your phone GPS to check if you are in Germany.
- **[Revolut](/out/revolut)**  
    A British online bank. They accept the most people.[^3] You get a Lithuanian [[IBAN]]. You can withdraw 200€ per month for free.
    - They speak German and English.
    - They accept most passports. No [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or *[[Anmeldung]]* needed.
- **[Wise](/out/wise)**  
    A British online bank. You get a Belgian [[IBAN]]. You can withdraw 200€ per month for free.
    - They speak English, Chinese, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Ukrainian.
    - They accept [most passport types](/out/wise-supported-passports). No *[[Anmeldung]]* needed.

[Monese](/out/monese), [Tomorrow](/out/tomorrow) and [Vivid](/out/vivid) are also good options.

**Traditional banks** can be expat-friendly, but I don't recommend them. It takes too long to open an account.[^4] You must sometimes go to the bank in person, with an appointment, just to sign documents.[^53] Their online banking apps are bad. They have physical branches, but employees might not speak English.

- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)**  
    They speak mostly German. Online banking, customer service and some documents are in English.[^7] They sometimes need a residence permit.[^54]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)**  
    Basic online banking in English, everything else in German. You need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that's valid for at least 6 months.[^6]
- **[Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)**  
    Basic online banking in English, everything else in German. You need a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung) and a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^13] They accept Russians, Iranians, Syrians and citizens of other sanctioned countries.[^2]

If a traditional bank does not let you open an account, try again at a different branch.

### Banks that are not expat-friendly

- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - They refuse all recent immigrants.[^14] They only speak German.
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - You need German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or EU citizenship to open an account.[^15]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - You need an *[[Anmeldung]]*, or you must follow [extra steps](https://banks-germany.com/open-comdirect-bank-account-for-non-residents/). They only speak German.

## German banks with English support

### Banks with full English support

- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - English and 6 other languages
- **[Monese](/out/monese)** - English and 13 other languages
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - English and 4 other languages
- **[Revolut](/out/revolut)** - English
- **[Wise](/out/wise)** - English and 13 other languages

### Banks with some English support

These banks let you do some things in English. If you go to the bank in person, you might find someone who speaks English, but all their letters and documents are in German.

- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - Customer service and online banking in English. Some documents are only in German. They're the best option if you want a [blocking account](/glossary/Sperrkonto) or a bank with branches, but you don't speak German.
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - Basic online banking in English. Everything else is in German.
- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - Basic online banking in English. Everything else is in German.

## German banks with no monthly fees

These banks offer a **free bank account**:

- **[N26](/out/n26)** - No monthly fees.
- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - No monthly fees.[^16] They reject recent immigrants.

These banks have no monthly fee **if you deposit at least 700€ per month**:

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)**[^18]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)**[^20]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)**[^21]
- **[ING](/out/ing)**[^22]

These banks have no monthly fee **for young people**:

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - No fee under 27 years old.[^23]

These banks have no monthly fee **for students**:

- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - No fee for students under 26 years old.[^24] 8.50€ per year for a debit card.
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - No monthly fee for EU students.[^25]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - No fee for students under 28 years old.[^20]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank-students)** - No fee for students under 27 years old.[^21]
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - Just 1€ per month for the debit card.[^22]
- **[Volksbank](/out/volksbank)** - No monthly fee for students.[^27]

Even if a bank has no monthly fee, you might still pay a fee for the credit card, or to get money from an ATM. Choose a bank with no ATM fees; it's very important.

## German banks with no ATM fees

Some banks charge a fee to withdraw money from ATMs. It's usually around 7€ per withdrawal. On average, Germans use ATMs 3 times per month.[^12]

### Banks with free ATM withdrawals

These banks let you use any ATM for free:

- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - Free withdrawals from any ATM.[^35]
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - Free withdrawals from any ATM.[^36] Minimum withdrawal is 50€.
- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - 6 free withdrawals per month.[^33] You can only withdraw 250€ per day in the first 3 months, and 500€ per day after 3 months.[^34]
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - 3 free withdrawals per month. After that, you pay 2€ per withdrawal.
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - 3 free withdrawals per month. Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs). 9.90€ per withdrawal outside the [Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone).

[Wise](/out/wise-account) and [Revolut](/out/revolut) only let you withdraw up to 200€ per month for free. It's enough for most people.[^5]

### Bank with free withdrawals on their ATM network

Some banks have free ATM withdrawals, but only if you use their ATM network. In my experience, this is annoying. You sometimes need to walk an extra 10 minutes to find a free ATM.

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - 4 free withdrawals per month from Sparkasse ATMs[^37] (45% of ATMs).[^38] Otherwise, 2€ per withdrawal.[^37]
- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - Free withdrawals from Sparkasse ATMs (45% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of 2% (minimum 7.50€) per withdrawal from other ATMs.[^24]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs). Fee of 1.95% (minimum 5.98€) of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^21]
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of 6€ or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.
- **[Berliner Volksbank](/out/volksbank)** - Free withdrawals from BVR ATMs (32% of ATMs).[^52] Fee of 7.50€ or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^39]

## Blocked account for students

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you usually need a proof of financial resources (*[[Finanzierungsnachweis]]*). That means a scholarship or a blocked account (*[[Sperrkonto]]*).[^40]

You can open a blocked account with...

- **[Coracle](/out/coracle)**
- **[Expatrio](/out/expatrio-sperrkonto)**
- **[Fintiba](/out/fintiba)**
- **[Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - Only at some branches[^41]
- **[Kotak Mahindra Bank](https://www.kotak.com/en/digital-banking/insta-services/send-money-abroad/kotak-german-blocked-account-sperrkonto.html)**, if you are Indian.[^43]

Deutsche Bank does not offer blocked accounts anymore.[^42]

Usually, you only need a blocked account for the first year. When you renew your student visa, it might not be needed.[^17]

## Banks in other EU countries

These banks are based in other EU countries. They let you open an account from Germany.

- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - Licenced in Belgium. Accounts can have a German [[IBAN]]s.
- **[Monese](/out/monese)** - Licenced in Belgium. Accounts have Belgian [[IBAN]]s.
- **[Wise](/out/wise)** - Licenced in Belgium. Accounts have Belgian [[IBAN]]s.

There are a few problems with non-German banks:

- **Your money is insured differently**  
    When your money is in a German bank, it's insured up to 100,000€ by the German government.[^44] You get that money back even if the bank goes bankrupt. The rules can be different in other EU countries.
- **You might get a non-German [[IBAN]]**  
    This is rarely a big problem, but sometimes, you need a German IBAN. IBAN discrimination is illegal, but it happens.[^45] For example, people had problems when paying the[ vehicle tax](/glossary/Kraftfahrzeugsteuer) at the *Hauptzollamt*.
- **You can't get a [[Girocard]]**  
    This type of bank card only exists in Germany.[^46] Many small businesses only accept cash and Girocards, not Visa or Mastercard. It's not a big problem, because you can always pay in cash. I have no Girocard since 2016, and I am fine.

## How to open a bank account in Germany

### Minimum requirements

The requirements to open a bank account are the same for most banks:

- **A proof of German residency** (your *[Meldebescheinigung](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung)*). [Some banks](/guides/german-banks-no-address) let you open an account without one.
- **A proof of identity** (your passport or national ID, and sometimes a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel))

Some banks require a minimum income or financial history in Germany. Other banks require [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) in Germany. For example, [DKB](/out/dkb) often rejects foreigners.[^47] Some online banks only support certain passports,[^48] or ask for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).

If you are American, you need extra forms to open a German bank account, because of [FATCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act).[^49] Some banks don't let Americans open an account.[^50]

### Open a bank account online

Some banks like [N26](/out/n26),[bunq](/out/bunq), [DKB](/out/dkb), [ING](/out/ing), [Comdirect](/out/comdirect) and [Wise](/out/wise-account) let you open an account with their app. You can do it at home. They start a video call, and they ask you to show both sides of your ID or passport. This only works with passports from certain countries.[^51] If they don't accept your passport, you must use [[Postident]] to verify your documents. This takes longer, and it doesn't always work.

With online banks, you can sometimes open your account from another country, before you arrive in Germany. They still need to send your bank card to a German address. Some people sent the bank card to their office, or to a friend's address.

### Open a bank account in person

Some banks like [Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank), [Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse), [Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank) and [Volksbank](/out/volksbank) let you open an account in person at their branches. The employees there sometimes speak English.

These banks are often more flexible. They accept most passport types, and they let you open a bank account without a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung).

### Transfer money from another country

After you open a German bank account, use [Wise](/out/wise) or [XE.com](https://www.xe.com/) to transfer money from another country. They have better exchange rates and lower fees than banks. I used Wise when I moved to Germany. I still use it when I need to send money abroad. You can use Wise directly in the N26 app.

## Which bank should I choose?

Choose a bank that...

- speaks your language
- accepts your passport
- has no monthly fees
- has no ATM fees
- gives a free Visa or Mastercard
- gives you a German [[IBAN]], if possible

**The best banks for foreigners** are **[N26](/out/n26)** and **[bunq](/out/bunq)**. I use N26 since 2016, and [I recommend them](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26).

[Wise](/out/wise-account) and [Revolut](/out/revolut) are also good options. The only problems are the low free withdrawal limits, and the non-German IBAN [[IBAN]].

**If you can't open an account anywhere**, [Revolut](/out/revolut) or [Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse) might work. They accept pretty much everyone.[^3]

**The best German-speaking banks** are [DKB](/out/dkb) and [ING](/out/ing), but they don't accept recent immigrants.
