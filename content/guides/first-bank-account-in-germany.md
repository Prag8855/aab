## Why you need a bank account

You need a bank account to...

- get paid by your employer
- pay your rent
- pay all kinds of [taxes](/guides/taxes)
- buy things online and in stores

Your bank must allow [SEPA transfers](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung). This is how your employer pays you, and how you pay your rent and your taxes. All EU banks and most European banks allow SEPA transfers.[^0]

You don't need a German bank. You can open a bank account in any EU country.

## German banks for expats

If you are new in Germany, it's harder to open a bank account. Banks often ask for a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung), a [job](/guides/find-a-job-in-berlin), a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or credit history. Banks often refuse passports from certain countries.[^1]

An expat-friendly bank makes it easier to open an account.

### Expat-friendly banks

- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - They speak 7 languages.[^2] They accept [many passport types](https://together.bunq.com/d/3355-what-id-documents-are-accepted-for-my-identity-verification). They don't need an *[[Anmeldung]]*. You get a German IBAN.[^3] When you open an account, their app uses GPS to check if you are in Germany.[^4] You can bypass this if you contact customer support.
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - They have basic online banking in English. The rest is in German. If you open an account in person, they accept most passport types.[^5] You must have a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), and it must be valid for at least 6 months.[^6]
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - Online banking, customer service and some documents are in English.[^7] The rest is in German. If you open an account in person, they accept most passport types.[^8] They offer [blocking accounts](/glossary/Sperrkonto) for foreign students.
- **[Monese](/out/monese)** - They speak 14 languages. They don't ask for an *[[Anmeldung]]*. You get a Belgian [[IBAN]].
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - They speak 5 languages.[^9] They accept [many passport types](/out/n26-supported-passports). You need a plastic [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that is valid for at least 1 year.[^10] They don't ask for an *[[Anmeldung]]*. If you open an account from Germany, you get a German [[IBAN]].[^11] You need a German address to receive your bank card, but you don't need a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung).
- **[Wise](/out/transferwise)** - They speak 14 languages. They accept [most passport types](https://wise.com/help/articles/2949801/how-does-wise-verify-my-identity?utm_source=allaboutberlin). They don't ask for an *[[Anmeldung]]*. You might get a Belgian [[IBAN]].

### Banks that are not expat-friendly

- **[Berliner Sparkasse](https://www.berliner-sparkasse.de/de/home.html)** - They require a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung) and a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^13]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - If you don't have a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung), you must follow [extra steps](https://banks-germany.com/open-comdirect-bank-account-for-non-residents/) to open an account. They only speak German.
- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - Recent immigrants can rarely open an account.[^14] They only speak German.
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - You need German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) or citizenship to open an account.[^15] Some students could open an account with a residence permit. Their customer support speaks English.

### Banks with some English support

These banks let you do some things in English, but you will sometimes need to understand German.

- **[Berliner Sparkasse](https://www.berliner-sparkasse.de/de/home.html)** - Basic online banking in English. Everything else is in German.
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - Customer service and online banking in English. Some documents are only in German. They're the best option if you want a [blocking account](/glossary/Sperrkonto) or a bank with branches, but you don't speak German.
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - Basic online banking in English. Everything else is in German.

If you go to your local branch, you can usually find someone who speaks English, but all the documents and contracts will be in German.

## German banks with no monthly fees

Some banks charge monthly fees just to have a bank account. Other banks don't have monthly fees. [Tarifcheck](/out/tarifcheck-girokonto) lets you compare banks with no monthly fees.

### Banks with no monthly fees

- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - No monthly fees.[^16] They don't let recent immigrants open an account.
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - No monthly fees.

### Banks with no monthly fees if you deposit money every month

These banks remove the monthly fees if you deposit money in your account every month. In other words, if you receive your paycheck there, you don't pay monthly fees.

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - 3.90€ monthly fee if you deposit less than 700€ per month.[^18]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - 4.90€ monthly fee if your deposit less than 700€ per month.[^19] No fees if you use Google Pay or Apple Pay at least 3 times per month.[^20]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - 9.90€ monthly fee if your deposit less than 700€ per month.[^21] A credit card costs 39.90€ per year.
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - 4.90€ monthly fee if you deposit less than 700€ per month.[^22]

### Banks with no monthly fee for students

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - No monthly fee for all people under 27 years old.[^23]
- **[Berliner Sparkasse](https://www.berliner-sparkasse.de/de/home.html)** - No monthly fee for students under 26 years old.[^24] 8.50€ per year for a debit card. Some branches offer a *[[Sperrkonto]]*.

- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - No monthly fee for EU students.[^25] 6.90€ for non-EU students.[^26] They offer a *[[Sperrkonto]]* for the German [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa).
- **[ING](/out/ing-students)** - No monthly fee for students. 1€ per month fee for a debit card.
- **[Volksbank](https://www.berliner-volksbank.de/homepage.html)** - No monthly fee for students.[^27]

### Banks with monthly fees

- **[Berliner Sparkasse](https://www.berliner-sparkasse.de/de/home.html)** - 3€ monthly fee,[^28] or 1€ + 0.30€ per debit card transaction.[^29] 2.50€ per month for a credit card.[^24]
- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - Minimum 3€ per month for the card. No other monthly fee.
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - 6.90€ monthly fee.[^30]
- **[Volksbank](https://www.berliner-volksbank.de/homepage.html):** 6€ monthly fee + 0.50€ for debit card.[^31]

**Some banks charge a fee for their credit cards**. For example, Commerzbank's cheapest credit card is 39.90€ per year.[^32]

## German banks with no ATM fees

Some banks charge a fee to withdraw money from ATMs. It's usually around 7€ per withdrawal. On average, Germans use ATMs 3 times per month.[^12]

### Banks with free ATM withdrawals

These banks let you use any ATM for free.

- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - 4 to 5 free withdrawals per month.[^33] You can only withdraw 250€ per day in the first 3 months, and 500€ per day after 3 months.[^34]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - 3 free withdrawals per month. Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs). 9.90€ per withdrawal outside the [Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone).
- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - Free withdrawals from any ATM.[^35]
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - Free withdrawals from any ATM.[^36] Minimum withdrawal is 50€.
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - 3 free withdrawals per month. After that, you pay 2€ per withdrawal.

### Bank with free withdrawals on their ATM network

Some banks have free ATM withdrawals, but only if you use their ATM network. In my experience, this is annoying. You sometimes need to walk an extra 10 minutes to find a free ATM.

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - 4 free withdrawals per month from Sparkasse ATMs[^37] (45% of ATMs).[^38] Otherwise, 2€ per withdrawal.[^37]
- **[Berliner Sparkasse](https://www.berliner-sparkasse.de/de/home.html)** - Free withdrawals from Sparkasse ATMs (45% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of 2% (minimum 7.50€) per withdrawal from other ATMs.[^24]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs). Fee of 1.95% (minimum 5.98€) of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^21]
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of 6€ or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.
- **[Volksbank](https://www.berliner-volksbank.de/homepage.html)** - Free withdrawals from BVR ATMs (32% of ATMs).[^52] Fee of 7.50€ or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^39]

## German banks for students

Go to **[German banks with no monthly fees](#german-banks-with-no-monthly-fees)**

### Blocked account (Sperrkonto) for the student visa

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you usually need a proof of financial resources (*[[Finanzierungsnachweis]]*): a scholarship or a blocked account (*[[Sperrkonto]]*).[^40]

Usually, you only need a blocked account for the first year. When you renew your student visa, it might not be needed.[^17]

You can open a blocked account with...

- **[Coracle](/out/coracle)**
- **[Expatrio](https://www.expatrio.com/blocked-account)**
- **[Fintiba](/out/fintiba)**
- **[Sparkasse](https://www.berliner-sparkasse.de/de/home.html)**  
    Only some branches offer blocked accounts.[^41]
- **[Kotak Mahindra Bank](https://web.archive.org/web/20210228121845/https://msingermany.co.in/kotak-mahindra-bank-procedure-blocked-account/)**, if you are Indian.[^43]

Deutsche Bank does not offer blocked accounts anymore.[^42]

## Banks in other EU countries

These banks are based in other EU countries. They let you open an account from Germany.

- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - Licenced in Belgium. Accounts can have a German [[IBAN]]s.
- **[Monese](/out/monese)** - Licenced in Belgium. Accounts have Belgian [[IBAN]]s.
- **[Wise](/out/transferwise)** - Licenced in Belgium. Accounts have Belgian [[IBAN]]s.

There are a few problems with non-German banks:

- **Your money is insured differently**  
    When your money is in a German bank, it's insured up to 100,000€ by the German government.[^44] You get that money back even if the bank goes bankrupt. The rules can be different in other EU countries.
- **You might get a non-German [[IBAN]]**  
    This is rarely a big problem, but sometimes, you need a German IBAN. IBAN discrimination is illegal, but it happens.[^45] For example, people had problems when paying the[ vehicle tax](/glossary/Kraftfahrzeugsteuer) at the *Hauptzollamt*.
- **You can't get a [[Girocard]]**  
    This type of bank card only exists in Germany.[^46] Many small businesses only accept cash and Girocards, not Visa or Mastercard. It's not a big problem, because you can always pay in cash. I have no Girocard since 2016, and I am fine.

## How to open a bank account in Germany

### Minimum requirements

The requirements to open a bank account are the same for most banks:

- **A proof of German residency** (your *[Meldebescheinigung](/guides/replacement-meldebescheinigung)*). [Some banks](/guides/german-banks-no-address) let you open an account without one.
- **A proof of identity** (your passport or national ID, and sometimes a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel))

Some banks require a minimum income or financial history in Germany. Other banks require [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) in Germany. For example, [DKB](/out/dkb) often rejects foreigners.[^47] Some online banks only support certain passports,[^48] or ask for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).

If you are American, you need extra forms to open a German bank account, because of [FATCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act).[^49] Some banks don't let Americans open an account.[^50]

### Open a bank account online

Some banks like [N26](/out/n26),[bunq](/out/bunq), [DKB](/out/dkb), [ING](/out/ing), [Comdirect](/out/comdirect) and [Wise](/out/wise-account) let you open an account with their app. You can do it at home. They start a video call, and they ask you to show both sides of your ID or passport. This only works with passports from certain countries.[^51] If they don't accept your passport, you must use [[Postident]] to verify your documents. This takes longer, and it doesn't always work.

With online banks, you can sometimes open your account from another country, before you arrive in Germany. They still need to send your bank card to a German address. Some people sent the bank card to their office, or to a friend's address.

### Open a bank account in person

Some banks like [Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank), [Sparkasse](https://www.berliner-sparkasse.de/de/home.html), [Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank) and [Volksbank](https://www.berliner-volksbank.de/homepage.html) let you open an account in person at their branches. The employees there sometimes speak English.

These banks are often more flexible. They accept most passport types, and they let you open a bank account without a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung).

### Transfer money from another country

After you open a German bank account, use [Wise](/out/transferwise) or [XE.com](https://www.xe.com/) to transfer money from another country. They have better exchange rates and lower fees than banks. I used Wise when I moved to Germany. I still use it when I need to send money abroad. You can use Wise directly [in the N26 app](https://n26.com/en-de/wise).

## Which bank should I pick?

Choose a bank...

- that speaks your language
- that accepts your passport
- without monthly fees
- without ATM fees
- with a free Visa or Mastercard

I am with [N26](/out/n26) since 2016. My [review of N26](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26) explains why. I also use [Kontist](/out/kontist) for my business account, and [Degiro](/out/degiro) to trade stocks.

If you speak German, look at [DKB](/out/dkb) and [ING](/out/ing). People often recommend them.

If no banks accept your passport, try [Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank). Online banks like [bunq](/out/bunq), [Monese](/out/monese) and [Wise](/out/wise-account) also accept more passport types.
