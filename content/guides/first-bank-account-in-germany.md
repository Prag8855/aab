An expat-friendly bank...

- Lets you open an account quickly
- Accepts foreign passports and documents
- Does not ask for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)

These banks are **expat-friendly**:

    An German online bank. It's my bank since 2016, and [I recommend them](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26). You get 3 free ATM withdrawals per month.

These banks are **not expat-friendly**:

- **[Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)**  
    If you want a traditional bank with physical branches, this is the best option. They accept Russians, Iranians, Syrians and citizens of other sanctioned countries.[^2] You need a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung) and a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^13] Basic online banking is in English, everything else is in German.
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)**  
    It takes too long to open an account.[^10] They mostly speak German. Online banking, customer service and some documents are in English.[^7] You might need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^54]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)**  
    It takes too long to open an account.[^9] You need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that's valid for at least 6 months.[^6] Basic online banking is in English, everything else is in German.
- **[ING](/out/ing)**  
    It's a good bank, but you need EU citizenship or German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) to open an account.[^15] They only speak German.
- **[DKB](/out/dkb)**  
    It's a good bank, but they refuse all recent immigrants.[^14] They only speak German.

    You need an *[[Anmeldung]]*, or you must follow [extra steps](https://banks-germany.com/open-comdirect-bank-account-for-non-residents/). They only speak German.

## English-speaking banks

These banks let you do **everything in English**. Their online banking, documents and customer service are in English.

- **[N26](/out/n26)** - English and 4 other languages

- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - Basic online banking in English.

## Banks with no monthly fees

These banks offer a **free bank account** with no monthly fees:

- **[N26](/out/n26)** - No monthly fees.
- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - No monthly fees.[^16] They reject recent immigrants.

These banks have no monthly fee **if you deposit at least 700€ per month**:

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)**[^18]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)**[^20]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)**[^21]
- **[ING](/out/ing)**[^22]

These banks have no monthly fee **for young people**:

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - No fee under 27 years old.[^23]

These banks have no monthly fee **for students**:

- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - No fee for students under 26 years old.[^24] 8.50€ per year for a debit card.
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - No monthly fee for EU students.[^25]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - No fee for students under 28 years old.[^20]

- **[ING](/out/ing)** - Just 1€ per month for the debit card.[^22]
- **[Volksbank](/out/volksbank)** - No monthly fee for students.[^27]

These banks might still charge for a credit card, or to withdraw money from an ATM. Choose a bank with no ATM fees.

## Banks with no ATM fees

Some banks charge a fee to get cash from ATMs. It's usually around 7€ per withdrawal. On average, Germans use ATMs around 3 times per month. They withdraw less than 200€ per month.[^12]

### Banks with free ATM withdrawals

These banks let you **use any ATM for free**:

- **[DKB](/out/dkb)** - Free withdrawals from any ATM.[^35]
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - Free withdrawals from any ATM.[^36] Minimum withdrawal is 50€.
- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - 6 free withdrawals per month.[^33] You can only withdraw 250€ per day in the first 3 months, and 500€ per day after 3 months.[^34]
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - 3 free withdrawals per month. After that, you pay 2€ per withdrawal.
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - 3 free withdrawals per month. Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs). 9.90€ per withdrawal outside the [Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone).
- **[Wise](/out/wise-account)** - Withdraw up to 200€ per month for free.
- **[Revolut](/out/revolut)** - Withdraw up to 200€ per month for free.

These banks only let you **use some ATMs for free**. You might need to walk another 10 minutes to find a free ATM. I don't recommend them.

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - 4 free withdrawals per month from Sparkasse ATMs[^37] (45% of ATMs).[^38] Otherwise, 2€ per withdrawal.[^37]
- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - Free withdrawals from Sparkasse ATMs (45% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of 2% (minimum 7.50€) per withdrawal from other ATMs.[^24]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs). Fee of 1.95% (minimum 5.98€) of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^21]
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - Free withdrawals from Cash Group ATMs (15% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of 6€ or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.
- **[Berliner Volksbank](/out/volksbank)** - Free withdrawals from BVR ATMs (32% of ATMs).[^52] Fee of 7.50€ or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^39]

## Blocked account for students

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you usually need a proof of financial resources (*[[Finanzierungsnachweis]]*). That means a scholarship or a blocked account (*[[Sperrkonto]]*).[^40]

You can open a blocked account with...

- **[Expatrio](/out/expatrio)**
- **[Fintiba](/out/fintiba)**
- **[Coracle](/out/coracle)**
- **[Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - Only at some branches[^41]
- **[Kotak Mahindra Bank](https://www.kotak.com/en/digital-banking/insta-services/send-money-abroad/kotak-german-blocked-account-sperrkonto.html)**, if you are Indian.[^43]

Deutsche Bank does not offer blocked accounts anymore.[^42]

Usually, you only need a blocked account for the first year. When you renew your student visa, it might not be needed.[^17]

## Banks in other EU countries

You don't need a German bank. You can use a bank in any EU country.

There are only two differences:

- **Foreign [[IBAN]]**  
    IBAN discrimination is illegal, but it still happens.[^45] Some businesses refuse foreign bank account numbers ([[IBAN]]). If your IBAN does not start with "DE", you might get an error. If you can, choose a bank that gives you a German IBAN.
- **No [[Girocard]]**  
    Girocards are a common payment method in Germany. Only German banks give you a Girocard. Many small businesses only accept cash and Girocards, no Visa or Mastercard. It's rarely a problem; you can just pay with cash. I have no Girocard since 2016, and I never had a problem.

Your money is insured up to 100,000€ in all EU countries.[^8] Your money is safe in any EU bank account.

## Which bank should I choose?

**The best banks for foreigners** are [N26](/out/n26) and [bunq](/out/bunq). I use N26 since 2016, and [I recommend them](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26). [Revolut](/out/revolut) and [Wise](/out/wise-account) are also good options, but they have a low free withdrawal limit, and no German [[IBAN]]. 

**If you can't open an account anywhere**, [Revolut](/out/revolut) or [Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse) might work. They accept pretty much everyone.[^3]

**The best German-speaking banks** are [DKB](/out/dkb) and [ING](/out/ing), but they don't accept recent immigrants.
