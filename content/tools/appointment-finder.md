## Other appointment types

This tool can only make one request every 3 minutes. The city of Berlin made this rule.

To find appointments for other services, it must make more requests. To make more requests, I need permission from the [IKT-ZMS team](https://www.berlin.de/moderne-verwaltung/buergerservice/vor-ort/terminvereinbarung/artikel.959989.php). I have asked many times, but they do not reply to my emails. Without their approval, this tool can only find *[[Anmeldung]]* appointments.

**To look for other appointment types**, you can [run the appointment finder on your computer](https://github.com/nicbou/burgeramt-appointments-websockets). There are also [other ways to find an appointment](/guides/berlin-burgeramt-appointment).
