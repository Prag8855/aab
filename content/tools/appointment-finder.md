## Other appointment types

This tool only finds *Anmeldung* appointments. It can't find other *Bürgeramt* or *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* appointments.

This tool makes 1 request every 3 minutes. To find more appointment types, it must make more requests. If it makes more requests, it gets blocked.

There are other ways to find an appointment. You can also [run this tool on your computer](https://github.com/all-about-berlin/burgeramt-appointments) and look for other appointment types.
