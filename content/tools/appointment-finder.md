## About this tool

I built this tool in 2022. It's approved by the city of Berlin. You can [learn why I made it](https://nicolasbouliane.com/projects/appointment-finder), [contribute to its development](https://github.com/all-about-berlin/burgeramt-appointments), [run it yourself](https://github.com/all-about-berlin/burgeramt-appointments) or [donate a few euros](/donate) to support my work.

The tool can only make 1 request every 3 minutes. This is why it can't look for more appointment types.
