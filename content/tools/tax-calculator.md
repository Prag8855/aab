## The taxes you pay in Germany

All German residents must pay taxes in Germany.

If you earn the [median income](/guides/salaries-in-germany#median-income), you keep around 65% of your [gross income](/glossary/Brutto%20income). Around 35% of your income goes to taxes and social contributions. If you earn more money, you keep a smaller part of your gross income.

If you are an employee, your employer collects taxes directly from your paycheck. If you are self-employed, you pay taxes by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung) or [direct debit](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).

### Income tax

Income tax (*[[Einkommensteuer]]*) is a percentage of your income. It's a progressive tax: if you earn more, you pay a bigger percentage of your income.

If you earn less than {{GRUNDFREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per year, you don't pay income tax. The [median income](/guides/salaries-in-germany#median-income) tax rate is around 18%. The maximum income tax rate is {{INCOME_TAX_MAX_RATE}}%[^0].

[The income tax formula](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/estg/__32a.html) depends on how much you earn.

### Health insurance

There are three types of health insurance:

- [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It costs a percentage of your income.
- [Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). The cost is set by the health insurer.
- [[Expat health insurance]]. The cost is set by the health insurer.

If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it. If you earn less than {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you can use your parents' or spouse's health insurance for free. Students get a cheaper tariff.
