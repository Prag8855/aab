## The taxes you pay in Germany

All German residents must pay taxes in Germany.

These are the taxes that you must pay:

- [Income and salary tax](#income-and-salary-tax) (*Einkommensteuer*, *Lohnsteuer*)
- [Health insurance](#health-insurance) (*Krankenversicherung*)
- [Nursing care insurance](#nursing-care-insurance) (*Pflegeversicherung*)
- [Public pension insurance](#public-pension-insurance) (*gesetzliche Rentenversicherung*)
- [Unemployment insurance](#unemployment-insurance) (*Arbeitslosenversicherung*)
- [Church tax](#church-tax) (*Kirchensteuer*)
- [Solidarity surcharge](#solidarity-surcharge) (*Solidaritätszuschlag*)

Income from investments is taxed differently.[^3] You pay:

- Capital gains tax (*[[Kapitalertragsteuer]]*)
- [Church tax](#church-tax) (*Kirchensteuer*)
- [Solidarity surcharge](#solidarity-surcharge) (*Solidaritätszuschlag*)

If you are an employee, your employer collects taxes directly from your paycheck. If you are self-employed, you pay taxes by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung) or [direct debit](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).

### Income and salary tax

All German residents pay income tax (*[[Einkommensteuer]]*). This tax is a percentage of your income. It's a progressive tax, so if you earn more, you pay a bigger percentage of your income.[^2]

If you earn less than {{GRUNDFREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per year, you pay no income tax. If you earn the [median income](/guides/salaries-in-germany#median-income), your income tax is around 18% of your income. The maximum income tax is {{INCOME_TAX_MAX_RATE}}% of your income.[^0]

**If you are an employee**, you pay a salary tax (*[[Lohnsteuer]]*) on every paycheck. This is a prepayment of your *estimated* income tax. If you pay too much salary tax, you can make a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung) and get money back.

### Health insurance

All German residents must have health insurance (*[[Krankenversicherung]]*). Health insurance pays for your healthcare when you are sick.

There are three types of health insurance:

- [Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It costs a percentage of your income.
- [Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). The cost is set by the health insurer.
- [[Expat health insurance]]. The cost is set by the health insurer.

If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it. If you earn less than {{GKV_FAMILIENVERSICHERUNG_MAX_INCOME|cur}}€ per month, you can use your parents' or spouse's health insurance for free. Students get a cheaper tariff.

### Nursing care insurance

Nursing care insurance (*[[Pflegeversicherung]]*) pays for your healthcare when you are old. It costs {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_NO_SURCHARGE}}% of your income. If you are over 22 years old, and you don't have children, it costs {{PFLEGEVERSICHERUNG_WITH_SURCHARGE}}% of your income.

If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it.

### Public pension insurance

All employees must pay into the [public pension system](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung). It costs {{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_TOTAL_CONTRIBUTION}}% of your income.

If you are an employee, your employer pays half of it, so you pay {{RENTENVERSICHERUNG_EMPLOYEE_CONTRIBUTION}}%.

If you are self-employed, public pension insurance is usually optional. If you don't pay public pension insurance, you must make your own retirement plans.

### Unemployment insurance

Unemployment insurance (*[[Arbeitslosenversicherung]]*) pays a percentage of your salary if you lose your job.

It costs {{ARBEITSLOSENVERSICHERUNG_EMPLOYEE_RATE}}% of your income.

**[Unemployment insurance calculator ➞](/tools/arbeitslosenversicherung-calculator)**

### Church tax

If you are a member of certain churches, you pay a church tax. It's a percentage of your income tax.

If you live in Baden-Württemberg or Bavaria, it costs {{CHURCH_TAX_RATE_BW_BY}}% of your [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer). In other states it costs {{CHURCH_TAX_RATE}}% of your income tax.

You stop paying church tax by leaving the church.

### Solidarity surcharge

If you pay more than {{SOLIDARITY_TAX_MILDERUNGSZONE_MIN_INCOME_TAX|cur}}€ per year in [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer), you must pay a solidarity surcharge (*[[Solidaritätszuschlag]]*). It's a percentage of your income tax.

**[German tax calculator ➞](/tools/tax-calculator)**

### Capital gains tax

If you make money from investments, you pay a {{CAPITAL_GAINS_TAX_RATE}}% tax on income on all profit above {{CAPITAL_GAINS_FREIBETRAG|cur}}€ per year. This is the capital gains tax (*[[Kapitalertragsteuer]]*). It applies to profit, interests and dividends from stocks, ETFs and other financial investments.

Revenue from cryptocurrencies is not taxed as an investment, but as a private transaction.[^4]

Investment income is also subject to the [church tax](/glossary/Kirchensteuer) and [solidarity surcharge](/glossary/Solidaritätszuschlag).

## Tax classes

Your tax class affects how your [salary tax](/glossary/Lohnsteuer) is calculated. It does not affect how much [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) you pay. It only changes how much income tax you pay *in advance*, as salary tax.

You can change your tax class online with [[ELSTER]]. If you are self-employed, you might not have a tax class, because you don't need to calculate your salary tax.[^1]

There are 6 tax classes:

- **Tax class 1**  
    If you are not married, and you are not in any other tax class.
- **Tax class 2**  
    If you are not married, and you raise children alone. You get more tax benefits.
- **Tax class 3**  
    If you are married, and you earn more than your spouse. If you are in tax class 3, your spouse is in tax class 5.
- **Tax class 4**  
    If you are married, and you and your spouse have similar incomes. If you are in tax class 4, your spouse is also in tax class 4.
- **Tax class 5**  
    If you are married, and you earn less than your spouse. If you are in tax class 5, your spouse is in tax class 3.
- **Tax class 6**  
    This is the tax class for a second job. If you don't have a tax ID, your employer might put you in tax class 6. You have no tax benefits, and you pay more salary tax.

## How to pay less taxes in Germany

There are a few ways to pay less taxes. It depends on your situation.

- Contribute to a pension plan. Your pension contributions are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). It's only taxed when you get your pension. At that time, your income will be lower, so you will pay less taxes. It's a type of [tax deferral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_deferral).
- Declare your [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar) expenses. It makes your taxable income lower, so you pay less income tax. [Tax software](/guides/german-tax-software) and [tax advisors](/guides/english-speaking-steuerberater-berlin) can help you find deductible expenses.
- Get married. Couples with a big income difference pay less taxes if they are married.
