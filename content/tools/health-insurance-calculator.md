## Cost of German health insurance

The cost of public health insurance is a percentage of your income. The cost of private health insurance depends on your age and health condition when you sign up.

## How to pay for your health insurance

If you are an employee, health insurance is automatically deducted from your paycheques.

If you are self-employed, you pay by [SEPA transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung) every month. If you give your health insurer a [direct debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat), the payments are automatic.
