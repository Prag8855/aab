Your feedback helps us measure wait times at the Berlin *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*. This information helps other people plan their [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) application.

## Why this is important

The Berlin *[[Ausländerbehörde]]* does not measure residence permit processing times. Nobody knows how long their application will take. Some applications take 2 weeks, and others take 10 months.

With better information, people can prepare better. Waiting is less stressful when you know how long you need to wait.
