## Governance

This project follows the Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) governance model. The **lead maintainer has the final say** over all project decisions, including architecture, features and documentation.

This means that I might make decisions that you do not agree with, reject your contributions, or alter them beyond recognition. If you have big changes in mind, [let's talk about your ideas](https://allaboutberlin.com/contact) before you spend a lot of time on them.
