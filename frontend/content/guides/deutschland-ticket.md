## How to buy the Deutschland Ticket

You can buy a Deutschland Ticket from many different apps. You can't buy it from a ticket machine. It's only sold as a monthly subscription. The subscription renews automatically until you cancel it.

The Deutschland Ticket always **starts on the first day of the month**.[^3] This means that if you need a ticket from January 10 to February 5, you must pay for two full months.

**I recommend [mo.pla](https://en.mopla.solutions/en/tickets/deutschlandticket)**, because it accepts more payment options, and it's the easiest to cancel. They also support Apple Wallet and Google Wallet.

You can't use [hvv Switch](https://www.hvv-switch.de/en/) with foreign credit cards, even if you use PayPal.[^2]

### For tourists

The Deutschland Ticket is a subscription. You can't buy it from a ticket machine.

Tourists should **get a Deutschland Ticket from [deutschland-ticket.store](https://deutschland-ticket.store/autobus-oberbayern?lang=en)**. You can pay with foreign credit cards.[^4] You must still manually cancel your subscription before the end of the month.[^5] Your ticket is a QR code. You can see your ticket it in the [Bconn app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bconn.wallet&hl=en_US). It might take time to process, so buy it in advance.[^1]

**The other option is [mo.pla](https://en.mopla.solutions/en/tickets/deutschlandticket)**, because it accepts credit cards and it's easy to cancel.

Other options require a European bank account or a German credit card, and their Deutschland Ticket subscription is harder to cancel.

It can be easier to buy a regular daily, weekly or monthly ticket. You can buy them from a ticket machine at the train station. You can pay with cash or credit cards.
