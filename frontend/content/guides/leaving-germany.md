## Before you leave Germany

### Full checklist

- [ ] **[Quit your job](/guides/losing-your-job)**  
    The [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist) is usually 1 to 3 months. You can sometimes negotiate a shorter notice period.
    - [ ] **[Give your resignation letter](/guides/losing-your-job#give-your-resignation-letter)**  
        Your [notice period](/glossary/Kündigungsfrist) starts when your employer receives your [resignation letter](/glossary/Kündigungsschreiben). If you got fired or laid off, don't give a resignation letter.
    - [ ] **[Register as unemployed](/guides/losing-your-job#register-as-a-job-seeker)**

    - [ ] **[Tell your health insurance](/guides/losing-your-job#tell-your-health-insurance)**  
        When you are unemployed, the price of your health insurance changes. If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), it pays for your health insurance.
    - [ ] **[Use your vacation days](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-unused-vacation-days)**

### Close your business

- [ ] **[Tell the Finanzamt](https://verwaltung.bund.de/leistungsverzeichnis/EN/leistung/99102018120000)** (*steuerliche Abmeldung*)  
    It will stop [VAT](/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) and [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) prepayments.[^17]
- [ ] **[Tell the IHK](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/122107/)** (*Gewerbeabmeldung*)  
    If you have a *[[Gewerbe]]*, deregister it at the [[IHK]]. It will stop *[[Gewerbesteuer]]* payments and IHK membership fees.[^18]
- [ ] **[Tell the Künstlersozialkasse](https://www.kuenstlersozialkasse.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Mediencenter_K%C3%BCnstler_Publizisten/Vordrucke_fuer_Mitteilungen/Mitteilung_ueber_Auslandsaufenthalt.pdf)**  
    If you are a [KSK](/glossary/Künstlersozialkasse) member, fill [this form](https://www.kuenstlersozialkasse.de/fileadmin/Dokumente/Mediencenter_K%C3%BCnstler_Publizisten/Vordrucke_fuer_Mitteilungen/Mitteilung_ueber_Auslandsaufenthalt.pdf) and email it to them.
- [ ] **[Pay the exit tax](#business)**  
    If you have an AG, UG or GmbH, you must pay an exit tax.[^1] You can avoid it, but it's hard.[^14] Ask a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater) to help you. Freelancers and sole proprietors rarely need to pay an exit tax.[^26]
- [ ] **Save important documents**
    - [ ] [Tax assessments](/glossary/Steuerbescheid) for your business
    - [ ] Invoices and receipts
    - [ ] Proofs of income (*Einnahmenüberschussrechnung*, betriebswirtschaftliche Auswertung*)

    - [ ] [VAT number](/glossary/Umsatzsteuernummer)
    - [ ] [[ELSTER]] login details

Sole proprietorships are easy to close. If you have an AG, UG or GmbH, it's much more complicated.[^9] Ask a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater) to help you.

If you are part of a *Handwerkskammer*, *Berufskammer* or *Berufsgenossenschaft*, you must also deregister there.[^19]

## After you leave Germany

### Checklist

- [ ] **[Get your last bonus](/guides/losing-your-job#what-happens-to-your-pay-and-bonuses)**  
    If you leave a company before the end of the year, you can usually get part of your yearly bonus.[^4]
- [ ] **[Get your apartment deposit back](/guides/mietkaution#how-to-get-your-kaution-back)**  
    Your landlord can take up to 12 months to return your deposit. After you get your last *[[Nebenkostenabrechnung]]*, you should get the rest of your deposit back.
- [ ] **[Make a tax declaration](/guides/moving-in#deduct-your-moving-costs)**  
    If you move for work, your relocation costs are [tax-deductible](/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar). Since you stopped working in the middle of the year, you probably paid too much [salary tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer). Most people get money back.
- [ ] **[Get your pension payments back](/guides/pension-payments-refund)**  
    [Public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Rentenversicherung) costs {{RV_EMPLOYEE_CONTRIBUTION}}% of your income. If you leave the [EU](/glossary/European%20Union), you can usually get that money back.

These tasks are optional:

- [ ] **[Register on ELEFAND](https://krisenvorsorgeliste.diplo.de/signin)**  
    Register as a German living in another country. It helps Germany reach you if there is a crisis or natural disaster in your new country.
- [ ] **Close your [blocked account](/glossary/Sperrkonto)**  
    You might need a *Sperrfreigabe* from your local German embassy, consulate or *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.[^13] It might be easier to receive all blocked account payments, then close the account.

### What keeps working

These things keep working even if you don't live in Germany:

- **Public pension**  
    You can receive your German public pension abroad.[^6] If you can't get a German pension, [get your pension payments back](/guides/pension-payments-refund).
- **Private pension**  
    You can sometimes contribute to your private pension after you leave Germany. It's sometimes a good idea, but it depends on how pensions are taxed in your new country.
- **[Unemployment benefits](/guides/unemployment-benefits)**  
    If you move to another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country, you can still get [[ALG I]] for up to 6 months.[^15]
- **[German citizenship](#residence-permit)**  
    You are still a German citizen after you leave Germany.

### What stops working

- **[Health insurance](#health-insurance)**  
    Usually, your German health insurance stops working when you leave Germany. You can *sometimes* [keep your German health insurance](#health-insurance).
- **[Residence permit](#residence-permit)**  
    If you leave Germany for "non-temporary reasons", your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) expires.
- **[[Kindergeld]]**  
    If you no longer have tax residency in Germany, you stop getting *Kindergeld*.[^2]
- **[[Elterngeld]]**[^3]

## Bank account

**Do not close your bank account.** You need it to get your [apartment deposit](/glossary/Kaution), last paycheck, yearly bonus, tax return and [blocked account](/glossary/Pfändungsschutzkonto) payments.[^25]

Use [Wise](/out/wise) to transfer your money to another country.

If you have a [blocked account](/glossary/Sperrkonto), you can close it after you leave Germany. You might need a *Sperrfreigabe* from a German embassy, consulate or *[[Ausländerbehörde]]*.[^13]

## Health insurance

**When you stop working**, tell your health insurer. Unemployment [changes the cost of your health insurance](/guides/german-health-insurance/when-unemployed). If you get [unemployment benefits](/glossary/ALG%20I), it pays for your health insurance.

**When you disenrol from university**, your school tells your health insurer. Your [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) might become more expensive without the student discount.

**When you leave Germany**, your health insurance might stop working:

- **If you move to another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country**  
    Usually, your German health insurance stops working, and you must get insured in your new country. There are exceptions:
    - If you are retired, your German health insurance still covers you[^28]
    - If you study in another EU country, your German public health insurance still covers you
- **If you move outside the EU**  
    Your public or private health insurance stops working. Your expat health insurance might stay valid.[^21] Check with your insurer.

To cancel your health insurance, you need an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*.[^7] When you leave Germany, the notice period is until the end of the month.[^29] If you don't cancel your insurance, your insurer will keep charging you.

**If you plan to return to Germany**, get an *[[Anwartschaft]]* from your insurer. You pay a monthly fee to pause your health insurance, and resume it later. When you return to Germany, you will get the same tariff and coverage, even if your situation or your health changed. Without an *Anwartschaft*, it can be hard to find affordable health insurance.[^16]

## Taxes

### Income tax

Usually, when you leave Germany, you stop paying income tax in Germany.

You might still need to declare your income and pay taxes in Germany if...[^27]

- You still have investments, real estate or a business in Germany
- or you still have a place to live in Germany
- or you visit Germany regularly

### Stocks and ETFs

Usually, there is **no exit tax** on your stocks and ETFs.[^30] You only pay the [capital gains tax](/glossary/Kapitalertragsteuer) when you sell.

You must pay an exit tax if...[^20]

- You invested at least €500,000 in a single ETF or you own at least 1% of a company[^32]
- and you lived in Germany for 10 years
- and you move out of Germany

> **Example 1:** While you lived in Germany, you invested €500,000 in the iShares MSCI World ETF. You must pay an exit tax.

> **Example 2:** You invest €250,000 in two different ETFs. There is no exit tax, because you did not invest €500,000 in a single ETF.

> **Example 3:** You invest €400,000 in one ETF, and it's now worth €500,000. There is no exit tax, because the *purchase price* must be above €500,000.[^34]

### Cryptocurrency

There is **no exit tax on** cryptocurrency.[^31] Leaving Germany has no effect on your personal cryptocurrency investments.

### Business

If you own shares in a company, you must pay an exit tax.[^1] This includes companies in other countries. You can sometimes avoid the exit tax.[^14] Ask your [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater) to help you, or use the [list of tax advisors](https://wegzugsteuer.info/steuerberater) with exit tax experience.

You must pay an exit tax if...[^20]

- You own at least 1% of a company (AG, UG or GmbH)
- and you lived in Germany for 10 years
- and you stop being a German tax resident

**Freelancers and sole proprietors** almost never pay an exit tax.[^26] When you leave Germany, you just close your business. Your business assets (computers, office) might be taxed.[^33]

**[How the exit tax works ➞](https://eidel.io/notes-and-hacks-on-germanys-exit-tax/)**

## Residence permit

Your German citizenship does not expire when you leave Germany.

Your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) expires if...[^35]

- You leave Germany for more than 6 months (12 months for a [[Blue Card]])
- or you leave Germany for non-temporary reasons

Your [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) expires if...[^35]

- You leave Germany for more than 6 months (12 months for the [EU permanent residence](/guides/permanent-residence#eu-permanent-residence))
- or you leave Germany for non-temporary reasons

"Non-temporary reasons" has no fixed definition. It usually means that you quit your job, move out of your apartment, deregister your address, and leave Germany.[^36]
