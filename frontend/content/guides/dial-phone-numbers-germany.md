## German phone number format

German phone numbers have 3 parts:

- **The country code** (*Ländervorwahl*)  
    Germany's country code is **+49** or **0049**.
- **The area code** (*Vorwahl*)  
    Berlin's area code is **30**. Mobile phone numbers have a different area code, like **1522**. See the [list of area codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialling_codes_in_Germany). If there is no country code, put a 0 before the area code. For example, 030 or 01522.
- **The local number** (*Rufnummer*)  
    This is the rest of the phone number. For example, **901820**.

You can write the number without the country code. You must add a 0 in front of the number:

- **+49 30** 901820 ➞ **030** 901820
- **+49 1522** 3433333 ➞ **01522** 3433333

Sometimes, phone numbers are written as **+49 (0)30 901820**. This is the same as +49 30 901820 or 030 901820.

## How to dial German phone numbers

There are 3 ways to call a German phone number:

- **Dial the international number**  
    For example, **+49 30 901820** or **0049 30 901820**. This is the easiest way, because it always works. If you call from another country, you must dial the international number.
- **Dial the national number**  
    For example, **030 901820**. You must put a 0 in front of area code. If you call from Germany, you can dial the national number.
- **Dial the local number**  
    For example, **901820**. If you call from the same area, you can dial the local number.

> **Example 1:** +49 30 901820, 0049 30 901820, 030 901820 and 901820 are the same phone number.

> **Example 2:** +49 1522 3433333, 0049 1522 3433333 and 01522 3433333 are the same phone number.

## How to format German phone numbers

In German, follow the DIN 5008 format: +49 1522 343333. Each part is separated by a space. Without the area code, it's 01522 343333.[^1]

In English, follow the E.123 format: +49 1522 343333. Without the area code, it's (01522) 343333.[^5]

## Special phone numbers

### Emergency numbers

### Toll-free numbers

If a number starts with **0800**, it's a toll-free (*gebührenfrei*) number. For example, 0800 285 85 85. Toll-free numbers are completely free for the caller.[^2] Your mobile phone company won't charge you anything.

There are 2 ways to call German toll-free numbers:

- **Without the country code**  
    For example, **0800 285 85 85**. This will work from anywhere in Germany.
- **With the country code**  
    If you call from another country, put the country code before the number, and remove the first 0. For example, **+49 800 285 85 85** or **0049 800 285 85 85**.

Some toll-free numbers don't work with Skype, or don't let you call from another country.[^3]

### Premium numbers

If a number starts with **0900** or **0137**, it's a premium number.[^4] When you call premium numbers, you pay a fee. For example, **[09008 529 366 11](tel:0900852936611)** is a legal hotline that costs €{{LEGAL_HOTLINE_COST_PER_MINUTE|cur}} per minute. The cost is charged on your phone bill.
