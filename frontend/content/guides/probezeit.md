When you start a new job in Germany, you are in your probation period (*[[Probezeit]]*). During that time, it's easier to lose your job. This guide explains how the *Probezeit* works.

## What is the probation period?

When you start working for a company, you have a 6 month probation period.[^0] Some employers have shorter probation periods, or no probation period at all.

During your probation, it's easier to lose your job. Your employer can fire you without any reason, with a 2 week [notice period](/glossary/K%C3%BCndigungsfrist).[^1] Many people find the probation period stressful, because they are afraid of [losing their job](/guides/losing-your-job).

Apprentices ([*Azubis*](/glossary/Azubi)) have a shorter probation: 1 to 4 months.[^2] During their probation, there is no notice period; they can be laid off immediately.

## During your probation

### Vacations

You can take vacations during your probation period.[^3] In the first 6 months after you start a new job, your vacation days are prorated:[^0] you unlock 1/12 of your vacation days every month.[^4] After 6 months, you unlock all of your vacation days.

For example, if you have 24 vacation days per year, and you have been working for 3 months, you can use 6 vacation days. After 4 months, you can use 8 vacation days. After 6 months, you can use all 24 vacation days.

You should avoid taking long vacations during your probation period. It's not illegal, but some people think that it looks bad.[^5]

### Sick leave

You can take as many sick days as you need during your probation period.[^0]

In the first month of your probation period, get a [sick note](/glossary/Krankschreibung) on the first day that you are sick.[^6] The rules are different during your first month: you only get sick pay after you send a sick note to your health insurance.

### Pregnancy

Your employer can't fire you during your pregnancy, and 4 months after you give birth.[^7] This is true even if you are in your probation period.

### Quitting your job

During your probation period, it's easier to quit your job. Your [notice period](/glossary/K%C3%BCndigungsfrist) is only 2 weeks.

### Finding an apartment

It's harder to get a loan or [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) during your probation period, because you can easily lose your job.[^8] Landlords want tenants that have a stable job. Banks won't give you money if you don't have a stable income.

### Permanent residence

To apply for [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis), you need a stable, long-term income. If you are in your probation period, you might not get a [PR](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis). If you have a history of stable employment, you might get it anyway.[^13]

## After your probation

After your probation period, **it's harder to get fired**. It's also harder to quit your job. For most people, the end of the probation period is a big relief.

If your employer fires you, they must give you a 4 week [notice](/glossary/K%C3%BCndigungsfrist). If you want to quit your job, you must also give a 4 week notice. The longer you work at a company, the longer the notice period.[^9] After 5 years with a company, the notice period is 2 months. After 8 years, it's 3 months.

Some companies have longer notice periods in their contracts.[^10] 3 month notice periods are common, and some have a 6 month notice period.[^11] Your notice period (when you quit) can't be longer than the notice period of your employer (when they fire you).[^10]

### Taking vacations

After your probation is over, you can use all your vacation days for the year.[^12]
