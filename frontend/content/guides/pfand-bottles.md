In Germany, there is a bottle return system. When you buy certain products, you pay a deposit (*Pfand*) for the container. When you return the empty container, you get your deposit back. The empty bottles are recycled or reused.

The *Pfand* system is a big part of [sorting your trash in Germany](/guides/sorting-trash-in-germany). This guide explains how it works.

## How much is the deposit?

The deposit is **8 to 25 cents**. It depends on the type of container.[^0]

Bottle crates (*Bierkasten*) also have a deposit between €0.75 and €1.50. [^6]

## Which bottles have a Pfand?

### Bottles with a deposit

These bottles have a deposit.[^0] You can return them at any store that sells them, and you will get some money back.

- Beer bottles - €0.08 (€0.15 for [resealable bottles](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wulle.jpg))
- Aluminium cans - €0.25
- Single-use (*Einweg*) plastic bottles - €0.25
- Multiple-use (*Mehrweg*) glass and plastic bottles - €0.08 to €0.15[^1]
- *Landliebe* yoghurt containers
- Some wine bottles - €0.03

### Bottles with no deposit

These bottles can still be recycled, but they don't have a deposit.

- Milk cartons - They go in the yellow recycling bin. Plastic milk bottles have a deposit.
- Most wine bottles - They go in the glass recycling bins
- Containers with the [Grüne Punkt](/images/gruene-punkt-pfand.png) logo[^2] - They go in the yellow recycling bin

### Pfand keywords

If you see these words on the label or on the container, it has a deposit.

**Deposit:** "Mehrweg", "Pfand-Glas", "Mehrwegflasche"

**No deposit:** "Pfandfrei", "Ohne Pfand"

### Einweg and Mehrweg

There are two types of containers with a deposit:

- **Single-use** (*Einweg*)  
    The container is destroyed, and the materials are recycled.
- **Multiple-use** (*Mehrweg*)  
    The container is cleaned and reused. For example, beer bottles are multiple-use.

## Where to return bottles in Germany?

If a business sells *Pfand* containers, they must accept *Pfand* returns. They might refuse container types that they don't sell. For example, Aldi and Lidl only sell [single-use](/glossary/Einweg) cans and plastic bottles, so they don't accept [multiple-use](/glossary/Mehrweg) glass bottles.[^4] If a store is larger than 200 m^2^, it must accept containers from all brands, not just the brands it sells.

- **Supermarket**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    Look for a bottle return machine (*[[Pfandautomat]]*). [They look like this](/images/pfandautomat-edeka-bottle-return-machine.jpg). They are near the entrance, or at the back of the store. The machine will print a coupon. You must bring that coupon to the cash register to get your money back. Some grocery stores like Aldi and Lidl do not accept multiple-use (*Mehrweg*) bottles like beer bottles.[^5] Rewe and Edeka accept most bottles.
- **Liquor store** (*Getränkemarkt*)  
    If you have a lot of bottles to return, bring them to a liquor store like *Getränke Hoffmann*.
- **[[Späti]]**  
    They will accept the bottles they sold you. It's not a good place to return a lot of bottles.
- **Donate** your bottles to bottle collectors in your area. Use *[Pfandgeben](https://pfandgeben.de/)* to find them.

It can be hard to return certain types of bottles. If one place does not accept all your bottles, try a different place.

### Leaving bottles under trash cans

In Berlin, some people collect empty bottles to earn money. Leave your bottle next to trash can to make their job easier. They won't need to search inside the bin to find your bottle.
