**You might not need an appointment.** For example, you can [register](/glossary/Anmeldung) and [deregister](/glossary/Abmeldung) your address online. You don't need to go to the Bürgeramt.

## Book an appointment online

1. Choose a service in the **[list of services](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistungen/)**. For example, for the *[Anmeldung](/out/appointment-anmeldung)* or the *[Abmeldung](/out/appointment-abmeldung)*.

2. Scroll to the list of locations, and select all locations. You can go to any *Bürgeramt* in Berlin, not just the one near you. You can't go to a *Bürgeramt* in [[Brandenburg]].

### If there are no appointments

Sometimes, there are no appointments available. Try again every few minutes. Most new appointments appear during working hours. There are more appointments in the morning, between 8:00 and 11:00.[^0] Look for appointments everywhere in Berlin, not just near you.

The Bürgeramt does not release all available appointments online. Some appointments are only for people who call [115](/glossary/Bürgertelefon). Other appointments are only given by Bürgeramt employees.[^1]

### Multiple services, one appointment

You can book a single appointment for multiple services:

1. Select a *Bürgeramt* from the [list of *Bürgeramt* locations](https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/)
2. Scroll to the list of services.
3. Select multiple services
4. Click "*An diesem Standort einen Termin buchen*".

## Other ways to get an appointment

### Use my appointment finder

To [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung), use my [*Anmeldung* appointment finder](/tools/appointment-finder).

{% include "_blocks/appointmentFinder.html" %}

### Call 115

Call [115](tel:+4930115) between 7:00 and 18:00.[^2] This is the *[[Bürgertelefon]]*. They can find you a *Bürgeramt* appointment, even when there are no appointments online.[^1]

They only speak German. You must wait a few minutes to talk to someone.

### Email the Bürgeramt

Email your local *Bürgeramt*, explain what you need, and ask for an appointment. If your situation is urgent, include a proof. You might get an appointment faster, even if there are no appointments online.[^3] They usually reply in 1 or 2 days.

### Go to the Bürgeramt in person

If your situation is urgent, you can go to the *Bürgeramt* in person. They will help you on the same day, or give you an emergency appointment. For example, if you need documents to travel soon, you can go in person.[^5]

If your situation is not urgent, ask for an appointment by email. It's faster.[^4]

## How to cancel your appointment

If you can't go to your appointment, cancel it.

1. In your confirmation email, there is a link to cancel your appointment.  
    ![Link to cancel a Bürgeramt appointment](/images/burgeramt-appointment-cancel-link.png)
2. Click the link, and cancel your appointment.

    ![Instructions to cancel a Bürgeramt appointment - Step 3](/images/burgeramt-appointment-cancel-confirmation.png)

## Bring a translator

Many Bürgeramt employees only speak German. If you don't speak German, bring a translator or a German-speaking friend. I recommend [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter).

Appointments for the *[[Anmeldung]]* and the *[[Abmeldung]]* are simple, so you probably don't need a translator.

If you sign a *[[Vollmacht]]*, someone can go to the *[[Bürgeramt]]* for you. [Red Tape Translation](/out/red-tape-translation-interpreter) can do it. It's expensive, but it saves time.

## Contact the Bürgeramt

If you have a problem, email the Bürgeramt. They usually reply a few days later. Sometimes it takes a few weeks.

To contact the Bürgeramt:

1. [Find your local Bürgeramt](https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/)
2. Use the contact information on the page
