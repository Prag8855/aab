When you [move out of your apartment](/guides/moving-out) and leave Germany, you must deregister your address at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. This is called the *Abmeldung*.

This guide explains why and how to do your *Abmeldung* in Berlin.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Who needs to deregister

You must do your Abmeldung if:

- **You move out of Germany**, and you will not return to your current address.
- **You leave one of multiple homes**. For example, if you have two registered apartments, and you sell one of them.

You don't need to do your Abmeldung if:

- **You temporarily move out of Germany**, and you will return to the same address later. For example, if you study in another country for a semester.
- **You move to another address in Germany**. When you [register your new address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), your old address is automatically deregistered.
- **You have not [registered](/glossary/Anmeldung) your address**.

## Why you must deregister

When you do your *Abmeldung*, you officially stop living at your old address. You get a deregistration certificate (*[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*) that confirms this.

You can use this certificate to:

- Stop paying the [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag)
- Stop paying for [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung) (if you move out of Germany)
- Cancel your phone, internet and electricity contracts
- Get a [refund of your pension payments](/guides/pension-payments-refund), 2 years after you leave Germany

## How to do your Abmeldung

There are 4 ways to deregister your address:

- [By email](#by-email){{ RECOMMENDED }}
- [In person at the *Bürgeramt*](#in-person-at-the-burgeramt)
- [By post](#by-post)
- [Pay someone to deregister you](#pay-someone-to-do-it)

The *Abmeldung* is free. You can deregister 7 days before you [move out](/guides/moving-out). You must deregister maximum 14 days after you move out.[^0] In Berlin, this is not enforced; people take weeks or months to deregister, and there are no problems.[^18]

After you deregister, you get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*. This certificate confirms that you are deregistered. If you deregister in person, they give it to you. If you deregister by email or by post, you must ask for this document, and they will send it to you.[^1]

### By email

This is the **easiest option**, but it's not 100% reliable.

Each *Bürgeramt* does things differently. They rarely email your *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*. They might refuse to mail to another country, so you must give them a backup address in Germany.

To deregister by email, send this message to [any *Bürgeramt* in Berlin](https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/):

{% include "_blocks/abmeldungEmail.html"%}

Attach this to your email:

- [ ] The [*Abmeldung* form](/docs/abmeldung), filled and signed
- [ ] A copy of your passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*
- [ ] A proof of your move-out date, if you deregister late (optional)[^22]

If you deregister multiple people, also attach...

- [ ] A copy of their passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*
- [ ] A signed *[[Vollmacht]]* for each person you deregister

Write your new address in the form. If you use a German address, and [your name is not on the mailbox](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox), use "c/o" or "bei" on the address form.

You will get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]* 1 to 4 weeks later.[^2] They usually send it by regular post, not email or [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief). They might refuse to send it to another country.

### In person at the Bürgeramt

This is the **safest option**, because you always get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*.

To do your *Abmeldung* in person...

1. [Book an appointment](/out/appointment-abmeldung) for *Abmeldung einer Wohnung*. Choose any *[[Bürgeramt]]* in Berlin. If there are no appointments available, check again every few minutes.
2. [Fill the *Abmeldung* form](/docs/abmeldung)
3. Go to your appointment. Bring:
    - [ ] The [*Abmeldung* form](/docs/abmeldung), filled and signed
    - [ ] Your passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*, not a copy[^27]
    - [ ] A proof of your move-out date, if you deregister late (optional)[^22]

If you deregister multiple people, you must also bring...

- [ ] Their passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*, not a copy[^30]

If you [send someone else](#pay-someone-to-do-it) to deregister you, they must also bring...

- [ ] A signed *[[Vollmacht]]* for each person you deregister

The appointment is short and easy. It takes around 10 minutes. If you don't speak German, you probably won't need help, but you can still bring a translator.

During your appointment, you will get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*.

### By post

Send the same documents and message as when you [deregister by email](#by-email).

There is no reason to do your *Abmeldung* by post. It's slower, but not more reliable.

### Pay someone to do it

You can pay someone to deregister you address for you. They deregister your address and send you the [deregistration certificate](/glossary/Abmeldebescheinigung) by email. It's expensive, but it guarantees that you will get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*, and it lets you focus on other problems.

These companies can help you:

- [Deregistration.de](/out/deregistrationde-abmeldung)
- [EasyAssist](/out/easyassist-abmeldung)

They can also cancel your [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag), your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung), and your other contracts.

## What happens when you deregister

When you deregister, you lose your official address in Germany. This has consequences.

### Residence permit

You do not lose your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) when you deregister.

Your residence permit can expire if...

- **You leave Germany for "non-temporary reasons"**[^28]  
    For example, you deregister and move back to your home country.
- or **you leave Germany for more than 6 months**[^19]  
    For example, you travel for more than 6 months. [Some residence permits](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/en/residence/expiry/) let you leave Germany for 12 or 24 months. You can [get permission from the *Ausländerbehörde*](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/aufenthalt/erloeschen-von-aufenthaltstiteln/) to leave longer.[^26]

You still need a registered address to [renew your residence permit](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-renew-a-residence-permit).

### Health insurance

When you deregister, you can lose your German health insurance.[^14] German health insurance is only for German residents. If you want to keep your health insurance, you probably should not deregister.

If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), you can ask for *Anwartschaftsversicherung*. You pay a little money every month while you are outside of Germany. When you return to Germany, you can get your old health insurance back.[^15] It guarantees that you will get the same health insurance for the same price.

### Social security

When you deregister, you could lose access to [[ALG I]], [[Bürgergeld]], [[Kindergeld]] and other social services.[^16] Those services are only for German residents.

### Bank account

You can keep your German bank account. If the bank sends you a letter, and it can't be delivered, they might freeze your bank account.[^17] If they freeze your bank account, you can't withdraw money, use your credit card, or make [bank transfers](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung).

### Vehicles

You can't own a vehicle registered in Germany if you don't live in Germany.[^14] Some people had a different experience, so there are exceptions to this.

### Other services

When you deregister, you get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*. Use this certificate to [cancel your phone, internet and electricity contracts](/guides/moving-out#cancel-or-move-your-contracts) without fees or delays.[^16]

If you own a business in Germany, you might also need to deregister your business, or transfer it to another person.

## If you already moved out

If you already left Germany, you can do your *Abmeldung* by email or by post.[^23] You will not be punished.

## What to do next
