When you [move out of your apartment](/guides/moving-out) and [leave Germany](/guides/leaving-germany), you must deregister your address at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. This is called the *Abmeldung*.

This guide explains why it's important, and how to do it.

{% include "_blocks/tableOfContents.html" %}

## Who must deregister

You must do your *Abmeldung* if...

- **You [move out of Germany](/guides/leaving-germany)**  
    For example, if you move out of your Berlin apartment, and you move to Canada.
- or **you have multiple homes, and you leave one of them**  
    For example, if you have apartments in Berlin and Hamburg, and you move out of the Hamburg apartment.

Do not do your *Abmeldung* if...

- **You will return to the same address**  
    For example, if you study in France for 3 months, then move back to the same address in Germany.
- **You move to another address in Germany**  
    For example, if you move from Berlin to Munich. When you [register your new address](/guides/anmeldung-in-english-berlin), your old address is automatically deregistered.
- **You have not [registered your address](/glossary/Anmeldung)**

## Why you must deregister

You must deregister to...

- Stop being a German resident
- Stop paying taxes in Germany

When you deregister, you get a deregistration certificate (*[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*). With this certificate, you can...

- Stop paying the [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag)
- Cancel your German [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung)
- Cancel your phone, internet, electricity, gas and gym contracts
- Get a [refund of your pension payments](/guides/pension-payments-refund)

## How to do your Abmeldung

There are 4 ways to deregister your address:

- **[In person at the *Bürgeramt*](#in-person-at-the-burgeramt)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    It's the fastest way to get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*. You need it to cancel your contracts and your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung).
- **[By email](#by-email)**  
    It's easier, but you might not get your *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]* in time.
- [By post](#by-post)
- [Pay someone to deregister you](#pay-someone-to-do-it)

Deregister minimum 7 days before you [move out](/guides/moving-out), and maximum 14 days after you move out.[^0] If you wait longer, it's okay. Some people take months to deregister, and nothing bad happens.[^18]

When you deregister, you get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*. This document confirms that you are deregistered. If you deregister in person, they give it to you. If you deregister by email or by post, you must ask for this document, and they will send it to you.[^1]

### In person at the Bürgeramt

This is the **safest option**, because you always get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*.

To do your *Abmeldung* in person...

1. [Book an appointment](/out/appointment-abmeldung) for *Abmeldung einer Wohnung*. Choose any *[[Bürgeramt]]* in Berlin. If there are no appointments available, check again every few minutes.
2. [Fill the *Abmeldung* form](/docs/abmeldung)
3. Go to your appointment. Bring:
    - [ ] The [*Abmeldung* form](/docs/abmeldung), filled and signed
    - [ ] Your passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*, not a copy[^27]
    - [ ] A proof of your move-out date, if you deregister late (optional)[^22]

If you deregister multiple people, you must also bring...

- [ ] Their passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*, not a copy[^30]

If you [send someone else](#pay-someone-to-do-it) to deregister you, they must also bring...

- [ ] A signed *[[Vollmacht]]* for each person you deregister

The appointment is short and easy. It takes around 10 minutes. If you don't speak German, you probably won't need help, but you can still bring a translator.

During your appointment, you will get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*.

### By email

This is the **easiest option**, but it's not 100% reliable.

Each *Bürgeramt* does things differently. They rarely email your *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*. They might refuse to mail to another country, so you must give them a backup address in Germany.

To deregister by email, send this message to [any *Bürgeramt* in Berlin](https://service.berlin.de/standorte/buergeraemter/):

{% include "_blocks/abmeldungEmail.html"%}

Attach this to your email:

- [ ] The [*Abmeldung* form](/docs/abmeldung), filled and signed
- [ ] A copy of your passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*
- [ ] A proof of your move-out date, if you deregister late (optional)[^22]

If you deregister multiple people, also attach...

- [ ] A copy of their passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*
- [ ] A signed *[[Vollmacht]]* for each person you deregister

Write your new address in the form. If you use a German address, and [your name is not on the mailbox](/guides/addressing-a-letter-in-germany#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox), use "c/o" or "bei" on the address form.

You will get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]* 1 to 4 weeks later.[^2] They usually send it by regular post, not email or [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief). They might refuse to send it to another country.

### By post

Send the same documents and message as when you [deregister by email](#by-email).

There is no reason to do your *Abmeldung* by post. It's slower, but not more reliable.

### Pay someone to do it

These companies can deregister your address:

- [Deregistration.de](/out/deregistrationde-abmeldung)
- [EasyAssist](/out/easyassist-abmeldung)

They will deregister your address, and send you a [deregistration certificate](/glossary/Abmeldebescheinigung) by email. It's expensive, but it's faster and 100% online.

They can also cancel your [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag), your [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung), and your other contracts.

## What happens when you deregister

When you deregister, you lose your official address in Germany. This has consequences.

### Taxes

If you [leave Germany](/guides/leaving-germany), the *Abmeldung* tells the *[[Finanzamt]]* that you have left the country, and that you don't need to pay taxes in Germany.[^5]

You might still have to pay taxes in Germany if...[^6]

- You visit Germany often
- Your family still lives in Germany
- You still have an apartment or a room in Germany
- You conduct most of your business in Germany

For example, if you officially live in Spain, but your family lives in Berlin, you often go to a German doctor, and you own an empty apartment in Berlin, the *Finanzamt* might still tax you.

### Residence permit

You do not lose your [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) when you deregister.

Your residence permit can expire if...

- **You leave Germany for "non-temporary reasons"**[^28]  
    For example, you deregister and move back to your home country.
- or **you leave Germany for more than 6 months**[^19]  
    For example, you travel for more than 6 months. [Some residence permits](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/en/residence/expiry/) let you leave Germany for 12 or 24 months. You can [get permission from the *Ausländerbehörde*](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/aufenthalt/erloeschen-von-aufenthaltstiteln/) to leave longer.[^26]

You still need a registered address to [renew your residence permit](/guides/residence-permit#how-to-renew-a-residence-permit).

### Health insurance

When you deregister, you can lose your German health insurance.[^14] German health insurance is only for German residents. If you want to keep your health insurance, you probably should not deregister.

If you have [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung), ask for an *[[Anwartschaft]]*. You pay a little money every month while you are outside of Germany. When you return to Germany, you can get your old health insurance back.[^15] It guarantees that you will get the same health insurance for the same price.

If you move to another EU country, you are retired, and you get a German public pension, you can keep your German public health insurance.[^3]

### Social security

When you deregister, you could lose access to [[ALG I]], [[Bürgergeld]], [[Kindergeld]] and other social services.[^16] Those services are only for German residents.

### Bank account

You can keep your German bank account. If the bank sends you a letter, and it can't be delivered, they might freeze your bank account.[^17] If they freeze your bank account, you can't withdraw money, use your credit card, or make [bank transfers](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung).

### Vehicles

You can't own a vehicle registered in Germany if you don't live in Germany.[^14] Some people had a different experience, so there are exceptions to this.

### Other services

When you deregister, you get an *[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*. Use this certificate to [cancel your phone, internet and electricity contracts](/guides/moving-out#cancel-or-move-your-contracts) without fees or delays.[^16]

If you own a business in Germany, you might also need to deregister your business, or transfer it to another person.

## If you already moved out

If you already left Germany, you can do your *Abmeldung* by email or by post.[^23] You will not be punished.
