## German banks for expats

When you open your first bank account, choose an expat-friendly bank like [N26](/out/n26), [bunq](/out/bunq), [Wise](/out/wise), [Monese](/out/monese), [Tomorrow](/out/tomorrow) and [Vivid](/out/vivid)

An expat-friendly bank...

- Speaks English and other languages
- Lets you open an account quickly
- Accepts foreign passports and documents
- Does not require a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel), a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung) or a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer).

### [N26](/out/n26)

In my opinion, N26 is the most expat-friendly German bank. I use them since 2016. They let you open an account quickly, without an *[[Anmeldung]]*. They speak English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Their basic account **covers all your basic needs**: no monthly fees, free ATM withdrawals, multiple languages, a German [[IBAN]] and a solid mobile banking experience. Creating an N26 account creates a [Schufa](/glossary/Schufa) record. A Schufa record can help you [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin).

The biggest disadvantage: [the required documents](/out/n26-supported-passports). Depending on your nationality, you might need a plastic [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that's valid for 1 year. This is a problem for some recent immigrants.

**[My review of N26 ➞](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26)**

### [bunq](/out/bunq)

They are a **good alternative to N26**. They are more expensive, but they [accept more passport types](/out/bunq-supported-passports). They let you open an account quickly, without an *[[Anmeldung]]*.[^55] You must be in Germany when you open the account.[^16] After you open your account, you have 90 days to give them a [proof of residence](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung) and your [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer). They speak English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.

Creating a bunq account does not create a [Schufa](/glossary/Schufa) record.[^19] A Schufa record can help you [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin).

The free account is a little limited. The paid accounts have free ATM withdrawals. If you pay more, you get a German [[IBAN]].

### [Wise](/out/wise-account) and Revolut

Wise is the **easiest way to get a bank account**. They have the easiest requirements, and accept the most passport types.[^3] You can **open an account before you arrive in Germany**, without a German address, a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) or an *[[Anmeldung]]*.

The free account **includes most of what you need**: free ATM withdrawals (up to €200 per month), multiple languages, and a good mobile app. You don't get a German IBAN: Wise gives you a Belgian [[IBAN]]. This is [not a big problem](#banks-in-other-eu-countries).

Wise speaks English, Chinese, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Ukrainian.

### Banks that are not expat-friendly

These banks are **not expat-friendly**:

- **[C24](/out/c24)**  
    It's an excellent bank, but they [accept fewer passports](https://hilfe.c24.de/hc/de/articles/360011531579-Wer-kann-ein-Konto-beantragen), they required a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung), and they might require a residence permit.[^1] They only speak German. They don't accept US citizens.[^5]
- **[Revolut](/out/revolut)**  
    You need a [tax ID](/glossary/Steueridentifikationsnummer) to open an account.[^11] You only get it after you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung) for the first time.
- **[Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)**  
    If you want a traditional bank with physical branches, this is the best option. They accept Russians, Iranians, Syrians and citizens of other sanctioned countries.[^2] You need a [registered address](/glossary/Anmeldung) and a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^13] Basic online banking is in English, everything else is in German.
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)**  
    It takes too long to open an account.[^10] They mostly speak German. Online banking, customer service and some documents are in English.[^7] You might need a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel).[^54]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)**  
    It takes too long to open an account.[^9] You need a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung) and a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel) that's valid for at least 6 months.[^6] Basic online banking is in English, everything else is in German.
- **[ING](/out/ing)**  
    It's a good bank, but you need EU citizenship or German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) to open an account.[^15] They only speak German.
- **[DKB](/out/dkb)**  
    It's a good bank, but you need EU citizenship or German [permanent residence](/glossary/Niederlassungserlaubnis) to open an account.[^14] They only speak German.
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)**  
    You need an *[[Anmeldung]]*, or you must follow [extra steps](https://banks-germany.com/open-comdirect-bank-account-for-non-residents/). They only speak German.

## English-speaking banks

These banks let you do **everything in English**. Their online banking, documents and customer service are in English.

- **[Wise](/out/wise)** - English, Chinese, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish and Ukrainian
- **[Monese](/out/monese)** - English, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, European Portuguese, Bulgarian, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Polish, Czech, Turkish, Estonian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian
- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - English, French, German, Italian and Spanish
- **[Revolut](/out/revolut)** - English

These banks let you do **some things in English**. They have physical branches, and some employees might speak English.

- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - Customer service and online banking in English. Some documents are in English.
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)** - Basic online banking in English.
- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - Basic online banking in English.

## Free bank accounts

I strongly recommend to get a free bank account. Don't pay your bank to hold your money. In theory, every bank must offer a free account (the *Basiskonto*), but this account is often too limited.

These banks offer a **free bank account** with no monthly fees:

- **[C24](/out/c24)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    The best free bank account in my opinion. It's the only free account that includes a [[Girocard]]. They only speak German.
- **[N26](/out/n26)**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    The best free bank account if you don't speak German. It covers all your basic banking needs.
- **[bunq](/out/bunq)**  
    The free account is very limited: no free ATM withdrawals, no payment card, and no German [[IBAN]]. The paid accounts make more sense.
- **[Wise](/out/wise)**
- **[Revolut](/out/revolut)**

These banks have no monthly fee if you deposit money every month:

- **[DKB](/out/dkb)**
- **[ING](/out/ing)**: Free if you deposit €1000 per month[^28]
- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)**[^18]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)**[^20]

These banks have no monthly fee **for young people**:

- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)** - No fee under 27 years old.[^23]

These banks have no monthly fee **for students**:

- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)** - No fee for students under 26 years old.[^24] €8.50 per year for a debit card.
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)** - No monthly fee for EU students.[^25]
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - No fee for students under 28 years old.[^20]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank-students)** - No fee for students under 27 years old.[^21]
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - No fee for students under 28 years old.[^26]
- **[Volksbank](/out/volksbank)** - No monthly fee for students.[^27]

These banks might still charge for a credit card, or to withdraw money from an ATM. Choose a bank with no ATM fees.

## Banks with no ATM fees

Choose a bank with free ATM withdrawals. In Germany, you often need cash. On average, Germans withdraw cash 3 times per month. They withdraw around €200 per month.[^12] Don't pay €5 to €7 every time you use an ATM. It's a waste of money.

These banks let you **use any ATM in Germany for free**:

- **[DKB](/out/dkb)**
- **[ING](/out/ing)** - Minimum withdrawal is €50.[^36]
- **[bunq](/out/bunq)** - 6 free withdrawals per month.[^33] You can only withdraw €250 per day in the first 3 months, and €500 per day after 3 months.[^34]
- **[C24](/out/c24)** - 4 free withdrawals per month.
- **[comdirect](/out/comdirect)** - 3 free withdrawals per month. Use Cash Group ATMs for free (15% of ATMs). €9.90 per withdrawal outside the [Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone).
- **[N26](/out/n26)** - 2 free withdrawals per month, then €2 per withdrawal.
- **[Wise](/out/wise-account)** - Withdraw up to €200 per month for free.
- **[Revolut](/out/revolut)** - Withdraw up to €200 per month for free.

These banks only let you **use some ATMs for free**. You might need to walk another 10 minutes to find a free ATM. I don't recommend them.

- **[Berliner Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)**  
    Use Sparkasse ATMs for free (45% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of 2% (minimum €7.50) per withdrawal from other ATMs.[^24]
- **[Berliner Volksbank](/out/volksbank)**  
    Use BVR ATMs for free (32% of ATMs).[^52] Fee of €7.50 or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^39]
- **[Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)**  
    Use Cash Group ATMs for free (15% of ATMs). Fee of 1.95% (minimum €5.98) of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.[^21]
- **[Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)**  
    Use Cash Group ATMs for free (15% of ATMs).[^38] Fee of €6 or 1% of withdrawal amount for other ATMs.
- **[1822direkt](/out/1822direkt)**  
    4 free withdrawals per month from Sparkasse ATMs[^37] (45% of ATMs).[^38] Otherwise, €2 per withdrawal.[^37]

## Banks that don't require an Anmeldung

Many banks ask for a [registration certificate](/glossary/Anmeldebestätigung). You only get it after you [find an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin) and [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung). If you just moved to Germany, this is not possible.

These banks don't ask for a registration certificate:

- [N26](/out/n26)
- [bunq](/out/bunq)
- [C24](/out/c24)
- [DKB](/out/dkb)[^4]
- [Wise](/out/wise-account)
- [Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)
- [Vivid](/out/vivid)
- [Monese](/out/monese)
- [Revolut](/out/revolut)

## Banks with physical branches

Some banks have no physical branches. You do everything online or in their app.

Other banks still have physical branches. You can go there in person. In my opinion, you don't need this. Going in person is not better or faster.

These banks have branches in Berlin:

- [Commerzbank](/out/commerzbank)
- [Deutsche Bank](/out/deutsche-bank)
- [Postbank](https://www.postbank.de/)
- [Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse)

## Banks in other EU countries

You don't need a German bank. You can use a bank in any EU country. Your money is safe with any EU bank: it's always insured up to €100,000.[^8]

There are a few differences:

- **Foreign [[IBAN]]**  
    IBAN discrimination is illegal, but it still happens.[^45] Some businesses refuse foreign bank account numbers ([[IBAN]]). If your IBAN does not start with "DE", you might get an error. If you can, choose a bank that gives you a German IBAN.
- **No [[Girocard]]**  
    Girocards are a common payment method in Germany. Only German banks give you a Girocard. Many small businesses only accept cash and Girocards, no Visa or Mastercard. It's rarely a problem; you can just pay with cash. I have no Girocard since 2016, and I never had a problem.
- **No [[Schufa]] record**  
    Usually, opening a bank account is a good way to get your first Schufa record. Non-German banks don't create a Schufa record.

## Blocked account for students

To apply for a [student visa](/glossary/Student%20visa), you usually need a proof of financial resources (*[[Finanzierungsnachweis]]*) like a scholarship or a blocked account (*[[Sperrkonto]]*).[^40]

Usually, you only need a blocked account for the first year. You must deposit at least €{{SPERRKONTO_AMOUNT|cur}} in it.[^22] When you renew your student visa, it might not be needed.[^17]

You can open a blocked account with...

- [Expatrio](/out/expatrio){{ RECOMMENDED }}
- [Fintiba](/out/fintiba){{ RECOMMENDED }}
- [Coracle](/out/coracle)
- [Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse), but only at some branches[^41]
- [Kotak Mahindra Bank](https://www.kotak.com/en/digital-banking/insta-services/send-money-abroad/kotak-german-blocked-account-sperrkonto.html) in India[^43]{{ fail_on('2025-12-15') }}

Some [blocked accounts](/glossary/Sperrkonto) include [health insurance for your visa application](/guides/german-health-insurance/for-a-visa-application).

Deutsche Bank stopped offering blocked accounts.[^42]

## Which bank should I choose?

**The best banks for foreigners** are [N26](/out/n26) and [bunq](/out/bunq). I use N26 since 2016, and [I recommend them](/guides/an-honest-review-of-n26). [Wise](/out/wise-account) is also a good option, but they have a low free withdrawal limit, and no German [[IBAN]].

None of these banks give you a [[Girocard]]. If you need one, [C24](/out/c24) is a really good option, but they only speak German.

**If you can't open an account anywhere**, [Wise](/out/wise-account) and [Sparkasse](/out/sparkasse) accept most people.[^3] If you are Russian, Iranian or Syrian, [bunq](/out/bunq) and Sparkasse are the best option.[^2] If you need a blocked account, [Fintiba](/out/fintiba) is the best option.

**The best German-speaking bank** is [C24](/out/c24). [DKB](/out/dkb) and [ING](/out/ing) are also great, but they don't accept recent immigrants.
