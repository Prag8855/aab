Health insurance is more expensive for freelancers, because your employer does not pay half of it. For example, if your health insurance cost €250 per month as an employee, it will cost €500 per month as a freelancer.

There are 3 long-term health insurance options:

- **[Public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung)**{{RECOMMENDED}}  
    This is the safest option, because the cost is proportional to your income, and you can change your mind later. It costs {{GKV_MIN_RATE_SELF_PAY|round(1)}}% to {{GKV_MAX_RATE_SELF_PAY|round(1)}}% of your income. The [minimum cost](/glossary/Mindestbeitrag) is around €{{GKV_MIN_COST_SELF_PAY|cur}} per month. You can only choose public health insurance if...
    - You already have public health insurance
    - or you had public health insurance in Germany for 2 of the last 5 years[^9]
    - or you had public health insurance in another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) country for 2 of the last 5 years[^9]
    - or you get [free health insurance through your family](/glossary/Familienversicherung)
    - or you join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]*
    - or you join a [freelancer cooperative](#freelancer-cooperatives)
- **[Private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung)**  
    This option makes sense if you make over €60,000 per year. If you join at a young age, it's better and cheaper than [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung).[^8] [Ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if it makes sense for you. If you choose private health insurance, it's really hard to change your mind later.
- **[[Expat health insurance]]**  
    If you make less than €30,000 per year, and you can't get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), this is your only option.[^2] It's the cheapest option, but the coverage is bad, and [it's a bad long-term option](/guides/german-health-insurance#expat-health-insurance). Switch to public or private health insurance as soon as you can.[^6]

**[What is the best option? ➞](/guides/german-health-insurance#what-is-the-best-option)**

**If you apply for a [[National Visa]]**, you also need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) for your visa application. It covers you from the day you arrive in Germany to the day you get public or private health insurance. I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance). You can stay on expat health insurance, but [it's usually a bad idea](/guides/german-health-insurance#expat-health-insurance).

### The Künstlersozialkasse

If you are an artist, journalist, publicist or art teacher, join the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]* (KSK). They pay half of your health insurance, and half of your [public pension insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). It's always worth it.

Joining the KSK takes a few months. While you wait, you need public, private or expat health insurance.

If you earn less than €{{GKV_FREIWILLIG_VERSICHERT_MIN_INCOME|cur}} per year, you must switch to [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) after you join the KSK. It's a good way to switch from private to public health insurance.

**[How to apply for the KSK ➞](/guides/ksk-kuenstlersozialkasse)**

### Freelancer cooperatives

Freelancer cooperatives are a way to get [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung). You join the cooperative, and they become your employer. Since you are an employee, you can choose public health insurance. You still need to pay the full price for public health insurance: the employee's half, and the employer's half.

[Smart](/out/smart-coop) is a popular option. Membership includes services like invoicing, accounting, and legal advice.

## Insurance for a freelance visa

You must get health insurance *before* you apply for a [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa). Freelance visa applications are often rejected because of invalid health insurance.[^4]

Your options depend on your situation:

- **To apply for a [[National Visa]]**  
    To apply for a freelance visa at the German embassy or consulate in another country, you need [expat health insurance](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance). I recommend [Feather](/out/feather-expats), but there are [many other options](/guides/german-health-insurance#best-expat-health-insurance).
- **To apply for a [residence permit](/glossary/Aufenthaltstitel)**  
    To apply for a freelance visa at the [immigration office](/glossary/Ausländerbehörde) in Germany, or to convert your [[National Visa]] into a residence permit, the rules are different.
    - **If this is your first residence permit**  
        You can have [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) or [expat](/glossary/Expat%20health%20insurance) health insurance. Don't choose insurance yourself; [ask my insurance expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you.
    - **If you had a different residence permit before**  
        You need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. [[Expat health insurance]] is rarely accepted. Keep your public health insurance; it's the safest option.
    - **If you renew your freelance visa**  
        You need [public](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung) or [private](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung) health insurance. [[Expat health insurance]] is rarely accepted.[^7]

If you are applying for the *[[Künstlersozialkasse]]*, you can use expat health insurance plus a proof of your *Künstlersozialkasse* application.[^3]

## How to get insured

The best option depends on your citizenship, your income, your health, and your plans for the future.

If you are self-employed, **never choose health insurance yourself**. Always [ask an expert](/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you. It's a complex decision, and freelancers often make expensive mistakes. Choosing the wrong health insurance can also delay your [freelance visa](/glossary/Freelance%20visa) application.

## What to do next

After you get insured, you can [apply for a freelance visa](/guides/freelance-visa) and [start your business](/guides/start-a-business-in-germany).

You must pay for health insurance by [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-Überweisung) every month. You can sign a [direct debit authorization](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) to allow automatic payments.

When you are self-employed, you do not get paid [sick leave](/glossary/Krankengeld). If you are too sick to work, you have no income. You must prepare for this.
