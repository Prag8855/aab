## How to write German addresses

### The parts of a German address

German addresses are written in this order:

- **Person or business name**  
    German addresses start with the recipient's name. This name must be on the person's mailbox, or your letter won't be delivered.[^7]
    - **Intermediary**  
        If the recipient's name is not on their mailbox, [add "bei", "c/o" or "z.H." to the address](#if-the-name-is-not-on-the-mailbox). This is also how you send a letter to a person's office.
    - **Privacy details**  
        Add *Persönlich* (personal) or *Vertraulich* (confidential) if no one else should read this letter.[^5] It means that other people at this address should not open your letter.
- **Street name and house number**  
    Put the street name before the door number. For example, "Musterstraße 17". A building can have multiple entrances like "17A" and "17B".
- **Extra information** (*Addresszusatz*)  
    See [below ➞](#extra-information)
- **Postal code** (*[[Postleitzahl]]*)  
    Germany uses 5-digit postal codes. Always include it in the address, because big cities can have two streets with the same name. The [postal code finder](https://www.postdirekt.de/plzserver/) can help.
- **City name** (*Ort*)  
    For example, "Berlin".
- **Country** (*Land*)  
    For example, "Germany" or "Deutschland". If you are in the same country, you don't need to include the country.

### Extra information

Sometimes, an address is not enough. You must add extra information in the *Addresszusatz* field. It helps delivery people find your apartment. The *[[Bürgeramt]]* might ask for this when you [register your address](/glossary/Anmeldung).

- **Entrance**  
    Some buildings have multiple entrances. It can be hard to find your apartment.
    - *Haus B* (building B)
    - *Treppenhaus 3* (staircase 3)
    - *Vorderhaus* (entrance in the front)
    - *Hinterhaus* (entrance in the courtyard)
    - *Seitenflügel* (entrance on the side)
    - *Remise* (small building in the back)

![Parts of a building: Hinterhaus, Vorderhaus, Seitenflügel](/images/hinterhaus-vorderhaus-germany.jpg)

- **Floor number**[^3]  
    - Attic: *Dachgeschoss* or *DG*
    - 2nd floor: *2. Etage*, *2. Stock* or *2. OG*
    - 1st floor (after the ground floor): *1. Etage*, *1. Stock* or *1. OG*
    - Ground floor: *Erdgeschoss* or *EG*
    - Basement: *1. Untergeschoss*, *1. UG* or just *UG*

- **Apartment number**  
    German apartment buildings rarely have apartment numbers. Apartment numbers are written as *#123*, *Whg. 123* or "W123".[^4]
- **Side of floor**  
    If there is no apartment number, include the side of the floor. For example, "4. Etage links" (4th floor on the left).

### Simple example

If you want to write to your friend Max Mustermann, this is how you would write his address on the envelope:

![Envelope with German address](/illustrations/envelope-german-address.png)

> Name of the person you are writing to  
> Street and door number  
> [Postal code](/glossary/Postleitzahl) and city  
> Country

### If the name is not on the mailbox

German apartments rarely have apartment numbers. Everyone in the building has the same address. Each person has a mailbox with their name on it.

If your name is not on your mailbox, you will not receive your mail.

**If there is no mailbox with the person's name on it, your letter will not be delivered**. You must add "bei [name on mailbox]" or "[c/o](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/care_of) [name on mailbox]" to the address:[^2]

> The person you are writing to  
> **bei** The name on the mailbox  
> Street and door number  
> [Postal code](/glossary/Postleitzahl) and city  
> Country

For example, to send a letter to Max at his girlfriend Monika's address, write the address like this:[^0]

![Envelope with German c/o address](/illustrations/envelope-german-address-bei-person.png)

When you address an employee at a company, you can also use "z. Hd."[^6] For example, to send a letter to Max's office, write the address like this:

> The person you are writing to  
> **bei** The name of the business  
> Street and door number  
> [Postal code](/glossary/Postleitzahl) and city  
> Country

![Envelope with German business address](/illustrations/envelope-german-address-bei-business.png)

You can also use "zu Handen" (z. Hd.):

> The name of the business  
> **z. Hd.** The person you are writing to  
> Street and door number  
> [Postal code](/glossary/Postleitzahl) and city  
> Country

If no one else should read this letter, add *Persönlich* (personal) or *Vertraulich* (confidential).[^5]

> The name of the business  
> z. Hd. The person you are writing to  
> **- Vertraulich -**  
> Street and door number  
> [Postal code](/glossary/Postleitzahl) and city  
> Country

### Where to put the address on the envelope

It's the same as in most countries:

- The address of the person you write to goes **in the middle**.
- Your address goes in the top left. It's optional. If the letter can't be delivered, they send it back to this address.
- The postage stamp goes in the top right.
