## Taxes, insurance and pension

**Cost:** Around 35% of your income. Use my [tax calculator](/tools/tax-calculator).

In Germany, a part of your [gross income](/glossary/Brutto%20income) (*Brutto*) is for taxes and social contribution. Your employer automatically takes them from your paycheck. The money you keep is your [net income](/glossary/Netto%20income) (*Netto*).

## Housing

### Rent

**Cost:** €600 to €900 per month (room), €900 to €1,600 per month (apartment). Use my [rent map](/tools/rent-map).

In Germany, there is the cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*), and the warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*). The warm rent includes utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*).

Rent is usually your biggest expense. An unfurnished apartment costs €15 to €22/m^2^.{{ fail_on('2026-06-01')}} Temporary furnished apartments are more expensive.

If you just moved to Germany, you usually pay more for rent. [Landlords prefer stable tenants](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#what-landlords-want), so cheap apartments usually go to long-term residents.

If you just moved to Germany, you might need to pay more. Immigrants often get expensive furnished apartments, because they can't find anything else. After a few months in Germany, [get your rent lowered](/guides/moving-in#lower-your-rent) or look for a cheaper apartment.

### Electricity

**Cost:** €45 to €70 per month

In Germany, you pay two power bills:

- The heating and hot water that are usually included in your warm rent (*[[Warmmiete]]*)
- The electricity and gas for your lights and appliances. This costs €45 to €70 per month

**[How electric bills work ➞](/guides/electric-bill-berlin)**

### Internet

**Cost:** around €35 per month

For €35 per month, you can get a 100 Mbit/s internet connection.

**[Compare internet plans ➞](/out/verivox-internet)**

### TV tax

**Cost:** €{{RUNDFUNKBEITRAG_FEE|cur}} per household per month

Every household pays the TV tax (*[[Rundfunkbeitrag]]*). If you live with other people, you can split the cost. [In some cases](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag#how-to-pay-less), you don't have to pay it.

You get a TV tax invoice by post every 3 months. You can pay it manually with a [bank transfer](/glossary/SEPA-%C3%9Cberweisung), or automatically with a [debit authorisation](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).

**[How the TV tax works ➞](/guides/gez-rundfunkbeitrag)**

## Food

**Cost:** around €200 per month

If you only eat at home, you should pay around €200 per month for groceries. If you eat out, you will spend a lot more.

You don't need a car in Berlin. Cars are expensive to own and maintain. If you have a car, you must pay for parking, car insurance, [vehicle tax](/glossary/Kraftfahrzeugsteuer), fuel, tires and maintenance.

You need a [driving licence](/guides/driving-licence) to drive in Germany. It costs around €2,500 to €4,000.{{fail_on('2026-12-31')}} You can sometimes [convert your foreign driving licence](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence). It's cheaper and faster.

### Liability insurance

**Cost:** around €5 per month

[Liability insurance](/glossary/Haftpflichtversicherung) is optional, but it's *really* important to have. If you cause an accident, and someone sues you, the liability insurance pays for the damages. It costs around €5 per month. Most Germans have it.

## One time expenses

### Apartment deposit (Kaution)

**Who pays it:** People who rent an apartment

**Cost:** 3 times your [cold rent (*Kaltmiete*)](/glossary/Kaltmiete)

When you [move into an apartment](/guides/moving-in), you must pay a deposit (*[[Kaution]]*). You can't touch that money until you [move out](/guides/moving-out).

If you live in a [[WG]], the deposit is smaller. Sometimes, there is no deposit.

**[How apartment deposits work ➞](/guides/mietkaution)**

### Furniture, appliances, etc

**Cost:** €200 to €10,000

When you [move into your first apartment](/guides/moving-in), you must get new furniture, new appliances, kitchen equipment, etc. In Germany, you might even need to buy light fixtures, and a kitchen counter.

To save money, buy used furniture. You can find free/cheap furniture on [Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/) and [various Facebook groups](/guides/how-do-i-buy-and-sell-used-things-in-berlin#facebook-groups).
