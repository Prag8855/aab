??? Timeline ???

If you have a foreign driving licence, you can [convert it](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence). It's cheaper and faster.

### Language

You don't need to speak German, but it helps. There are [English-speaking driving schools](/guides/english-driving-schools-in-berlin). Even if you take German classes, the practice app is usually in English.[^30]

The [theory exam](#theory-exam) is in English, but the translations are really bad.[^31] I could not understand some questions in English or French. It's easier if you can take the test in German.

The [practical exam](#practical-exam) is usually in German. Some examiners don't speak English. You must understand simple instructions in German.[^25]

## 1. Choose a driving school

[Find a driving school](/guides/english-driving-schools-in-berlin) and sign a [contract](/images/ausbildungvertrag.jpg) (*Ausbildungsvertrag*) with them.

To choose a driving school, look at...[^23]

- **The costs**
- **The schedule**  
    Look at the timing and frequency of the lessons. Ask how long it takes to get your driving licence. Some schools have intensive classes. Classes in English are harder to find.
- **The distance**  
    If you take intensive lessons, choose a school near you.
- **The reviews**  
    Read the school's reviews on Google Maps. Don't trust the reviews too much; German businesses often delete negative reviews.[^21] Check if they make you more classes than you need.

## 2. First aid course

[Fahrschule Oscar](https://www.fahrschule-oscar.de/) and [Ersthelfer.tv](https://www.ersthelfer.tv/standorte/berlin-erste-hilfe-kurse/) give first aid classes in English.[^3] The course costs around €{{FIRST_AID_COURSE_COST|cur}}.[^19] It takes around 7 hours.[^4] There is no exam at the end.[^5] The first aid certificate is valid for 2 years.

If you are a doctor or a nurse, you don't need a first aid test.[^39]

You will get a first aid certificate. Bring it to your [*Bürgeramt* appointment](#burgeramt-appointment).

## 3. Eye test

You need an eye test (*Sehtest*) before your *Bürgeramt* appointment.

You can get tested...

- **During your first aid class**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    [Ersthelfer.tv](https://www.ersthelfer.tv/leistungen/sehtest/) offers first aid *and* eyesight tests. You can do both at the same time.[^6]
- **At your driving school**{{ RECOMMENDED }}  
    Some driving schools include the eyesight test.
- **At the optometrist** (*[[Optiker]]*)  
    You can get a free test from [Fielmann](https://www.fielmann.de/service/fuehrerschein-sehtest/) or [Apollo](https://www.apollo.de/service/sehtest).
- **At the eye doctor** (*[[Augenarzt]]*)

The eye test takes around 15 minutes. Bring an ID document to take the test.[^18]

You can wear glasses or contact lenses during the test. If you pass the test with glasses or contact lenses, you must always wear them when you drive.[^17]

## 4. Theory classes

When you find a school, you can start theory classes. You don't need anything else to start.

If you already have a car licence, and you are getting a motorcycle, you can skip some of the theory classes.[^24]

## 5. Bürgeramt appointment

You need permission from the *[[Bürgeramt]]* to take the theory exam. Get an appointment as soon as you find a driving school. Your appointment will be in a few weeks.

**[Book an appointment ➞](/out/appointment-driving-licence)**

After your appointment, you must wait 6 to 9 weeks to get the permission paper.{{ fail_on('2025-12-31') }} See the [current processing times](https://www.berlin.de/labo/mobilitaet/aktuelles/aktuelle-bearbeitungsstaende-736453.php).

When you get permission, you have 12 months to pass the theory exam.[^38]

??? What can you do in the meantime ???

### Required documents

Bring these documents to your *[[Bürgeramt]]* appointment:[^7]

- [ ] Passport or *[[Personalausweis]]*
- [ ] [First aid course](#first-aid-course) certificate
- [ ] [Eye test](#eye-test) certificate
- [ ] [Biometric picture](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin){{ fail_on('2026-01-01')}}
- [ ] Driving school [contract](/images/ausbildungvertrag.jpg) (*Ausbildungsvertrag*)
- [ ] Payment for the €{{DRIVING_LICENCE_FEE|cur}} fee - Check if your *Bürgeramt* accepts cash or credit cards.

### What happens during the appointment

The appointment takes 15 minutes. During the appointment, you must:

- Give the [required documents](#required-documents)
- Pay the €{{DRIVING_LICENCE_FEE|cur}} fee
- Choose the Dekra or [[TÜV]] location where you will take your driving exam[^29]

6 to 9 weeks later,{{ fail_on('2025-12-31') }} you will get a letter that gives you the permission to take a driving exam. Give it to your driving school, and they will give you a training certificate (*Ausbildungsbescheinigung der Fahrschule*).[^8] With this document, you can take the theory exam.

This permission is valid for 12 months.[^26] You have 12 months to take the theory exam.

![Bürgeramt permission for driving classes](/images/IMG_1312-1.jpg)

## 6. Theory exam

The theory exam is available in 11 languages, including English.[^27] You sit at a computer and answer 30 random questions from a list of around 1,000 questions. If you make more than 2 to 4 mistakes, you fail the test.[^28]

Some questions are really hard. The translations are really bad.[^31] **Memorisation is the only way to pass the exam**.[^11]

Your driving school will give you access to a practice app. The questions in the app are exactly the same as in the real exam. Even the translations are the same.[^12] You must memorise all the questions and all the answers. I needed 3 to 4 weeks to prepare.

When you are ready to take the theory exam, go to your assigned Dekra or [[TÜV]] branch. You don't need an appointment. It costs €{{DRIVING_THEORY_EXAM_FEE|cur}}.[^9] The test takes around 20 minutes.[^32]

After the test, you get a certificate by email. The certificate is valid for 12 months.[^33]

## 7. Practical exam

After you pass the theory exam, your driving school can schedule your practical exam with Dekra or [[TÜV]]. In Berlin, your exam will be a few months later.[^16]

The practical exam takes around 1 hour.[^14] It's similar to what you practised. Your driving instructor and the examiner will sit in the car with you. If you take the motorcycle exam, they will follow in a car behind you.

**The examiners rarely speak English**. You must understand enough German to understand their instructions.

The practical exam includes city driving, highway driving and a few technical maneuvers. You will drive from the Dekra or TÜV branch to a quiet street, and you will have to perform some maneuvers.

You must practice a lot. **44% of students fail their first practical exam.**[^15]

If you are not sure, watch [videos of German driving exams](https://www.youtube.com/@GermanDrivingSchool). These videos describe exactly how the exam works, in English.

You will then drive back to the Dekra or TÜV branch. This is also part of the test. If you passed the exam, the instructor will take your current driving licence (if you have one), and give you a temporary driving licence.[^34]

## 8. Get your driving licence

When you pass the practical exam, you get a temporary driving licence (*Vorläufiger Nachweis der Fahrerlaubnis* or *VNF*). It's valid for 3 months, only in Germany, and only with a valid ID.[^10]

You must give back your previous driving licence, so this is your only driving licence for now.

[![Temporary driving licence in Germany](/images/IMG_1316.jpg "Temporary driving licence")](/images/IMG_1316.jpg)

You will get your plastic driving licence by post 2 to 6 weeks later.[^36]

## Other ways to get a licence

### Use your EU driving licence

Your driving licence from another [EU](/glossary/European%20Union) or [[EEA]] country is valid in Germany.[^13] When it expires, you can convert it to a German driving licence. You don't need to take driving classes or a driving exam.

### Convert your foreign driving licence

If you have a driving licence from another country, you can convert it. It's cheaper and faster. You might not need to take driving classes or a driving exam.

**[How to convert a foreign driving licence ➞](/guides/convert-to-german-driving-licence)**

### Get your licence in another country

You must get your driving licence in your country of residence. If you live in Germany, you can't get your driving licence in another country.[^22] For example, you can't move to Germany, then get a driving licence in the Czech Republic.

There is an exception: university students from other EU countries. For example, if you are Polish, and you study in Germany, you can get your driving licence in Poland.[^37]

## What to do next

### Get an International Driving Permit

Your German driving licence is valid in all [[European Union]] countries. Outside the European Union, you might need an [International Driving Permit](/glossary/Internationaler%20Führerschein). In my experience, you rarely need an International Driving Permit. I drove in over 50 countries. I never needed it.

**[How to get an International Driving Permit ➞](/guides/international-driving-permit-germany)**

### Buy a car

**[How to buy a vehicle in Germany ➞](/guides/buying-used-car-in-germany)**

You can also [rent a car when you need it](/guides/public-transit#rent-a-car). If you don't drive often, car sharing is better.
