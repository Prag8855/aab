## With a German driver's licence

If you have a German driver's licence, you must book a *[[Bürgeramt]]* appointment for an *[Internationaler Führerschein](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/121591/)*. The ADAC does not issue International Driver Permits anymore.[^1]

**[Book an appointment ➞](/out/appointment-international-driving-permit)**

Go to your appointment and bring...

- [ ] **€15 for the fees**
- [ ] **A [biometric picture](/guides/biometric-pictures-in-berlin)**{{fail_on('2026-01-01')}}
- [ ] **A valid German driver's licence**  
    Temporary licences issued to new drivers (*vorläufiger Nachweis der Fahrerlaubnis*) are not accepted. You must bring a valid plastic driving licence (*Kartenführerschein*).

You will get a International Driving Permit during your appointment. It's valid for 3 years.

## With a non-German driver's licence

The *[[Bürgeramt]]* only gives International Driving Permits for German driving licences. If you have a driver's licence from another country, you must follow different steps. In most cases, you must request the International Driving Permit in your country of origin.

- **Canada**: From the CAA, while in Canada. No other authority can issue them.
- **United States:** The AAA can [mail International Driving Permits overseas](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html).
- **United Kingdom:** See the [official instructions](https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad/get-an-idp).
