Happy new year! I hope that your neighbours have lit the last of their fireworks. Orange-clad BSR employees are already hard at work cleaning up the mess.

Now comes the hard part of the winter. No more holidays or Christmas markets, just moody weather and public transit strikes.

How do *you* get through the winter? I did not finish — or even start — my winter survival guide, but my plan is museums and pubs. I am eyeing the [Ephraim Palais](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ko79xa91c1tTvvDbA), the [Barberini](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ue3vYfe9BwS9sT6z6) and the [Braun Sammlung](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KRt3E53ChhjGxqEd7). I also loved [Körperwelten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yvZWFjrYp6ZfGSdj8). My favourite pubs are [Leuchtturm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u64YGXkPT6aufkkV6), [Freya Fuchs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5av2WUneY32AAuz98) and [Alter Roter Löwe](https://share.google/FfC32MrZrCOmm431d), but there are *many* more on my [pub map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ihu1syWTexYntmz7).

## Rent map

I have made [a map of rents per m² in Berlin](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/rent-map). It helps newcomers set a budget for their [flat search](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin). The data was kindly provided by [Homeboy](https://www.homeboy.immo/en) and [Stekkies](https://www.stekkies.com/en-de/).

## Noise pollution map

I also made a [noise pollution map](/tools/noise-map). At the same time, Martín Aberastegue made [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/immonoise-noise-pollution/onhealgohmkcmddlemannchlgnihhgnh?pli=1) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/immonoise/) extensions that show noise pollution levels on ImmoScout listings.

## Changes to cannabis law

In 2025, you could get a cannabis prescription from an online doctor, and get weed delivered to your home. This created a small industry of online doctors who prescribed everyone cannabis, and online pharmacies who shipped it directly to your front door. It was fast, digital, and [*shockingly* easy](https://www.arbeitnow.com/blog/buying-medical-cannabis-online-in-germany).

And Germany took that personally. The government is passing [a law to ban telemedicine for medical cannabis](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/21/030/2103061.pdf). You will need to obtain a prescription from your doctor in person and collect it from the Apotheke yourself.

## Reminder: new in 2026

As mentioned in my [last email](/newsletter/december-2025), a few things are changing today:

- 💺 More expensive public transit: €63 Deutschland Ticket, €4 AB ticket, €5 ABC ticket
- 🍽️ Reduced VAT in cafés and restaurants: previously 19%, now 7%
- 💶 Higher minimum wage: previously €12.82, now €13.90 per hour
- 👷‍♀️ Higher minimum salary for [Blue Cards](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/blue-card): previously €48,300, now €50,700
- 👨‍💻 Higher income requirement for [freelance visas](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/freelance-visa) and student visas.
- 🩹 More expensive health insurance; the starkest price hike in years. Use my [health insurance calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see the new prices. [Ask my health insurance expert](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if switching to another insurance makes sense.

## Current projects

I am still working on my "leaving Germany" guide. It explains every little thing you must account for before moving to another country.
