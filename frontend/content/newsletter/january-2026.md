Whew, what a night! I hope that your neighbours have lit the last of their fireworks, and that the noise has petered out. Orange-clad BSR employees are already hard at work cleaning up the mess.

Now comes the hard part of the winter with its gloomy weather and public transit strikes. I have updated my watercolour palette to fifty shades of bluish grey.

I did not finish — or even start — my winter survival guide, but here is my two-step survival plan: museums and pubs. I am eyeing lesser-known art museums like the [Ephraim Palais](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ko79xa91c1tTvvDbA) and the [Barberini](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ue3vYfe9BwS9sT6z6), as well as the [Braun Sammlung](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KRt3E53ChhjGxqEd7). My favourite pubs are [Leuchtturm](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u64YGXkPT6aufkkV6), [Freya Fuchs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5av2WUneY32AAuz98) and [Alter Roter Löwe](https://share.google/FfC32MrZrCOmm431d). I have many, *many* more on my [map of saved pubs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ihu1syWTexYntmz7).

How do *you* get through the winter? Did you book a Mediterranean escapade, or do you just close your eyes and dream of the glorious summer ahead? My inbox is open.

## Rent map

I have made [a map of the median rents per m²](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/rent-map). It's based on tens of thousands of public apartment listings from the last 12 months. It should help newcomers plan their budget.

Thank you Jeroen and the [Stekkies](https://www.stekkies.com/en-de/) team for supplying the data.

## Changes to cannabis law

In 2025, you could get a cannabis prescription from an online doctor, and get weed delivered to your home. This created a small industry of online doctors who prescribed everyone cannabis, and online pharmacies who sold it to you. It was fast, digital, and [*shockingly* easy](https://www.arbeitnow.com/blog/buying-medical-cannabis-online-in-germany).

And Germany took that personally. The government is passing [a law to ban telemedicine for medical cannabis](https://dserver.bundestag.de/btd/21/030/2103061.pdf). Online doctors won't be allowed to prescribe cannabis, and online pharmacies won't be allowed to sell it. Everything will have to be done in person.

## Reminder: what’s new in 2026

As mentioned in December, some things have changed on January 1:

- 💺 More expensive public transit: €63 Deutschland Ticket, €4 AB ticket, €5 ABC ticket
- 🍽️ Reduced VAT in cafés and restaurants: previously 19%, now 7%
- 💶 Higher minimum wage: previously €12.82, now €13.90 per hour
- 👷‍♀️ Higher minimum salary for [Blue Cards](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/blue-card): previously €48,300, now €50,700
- 👨‍💻 Higher income requirement for [freelance visas](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/freelance-visa) and student visas.
- 🩹 More expensive health insurance; the starkest price hike in years. Use my [health insurance calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see the new prices. [Ask my health insurance expert](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if switching to another insurance makes sense.

You can find a longer list with all explanations [on my personal blog](https://nicolasbouliane.com/blog/new-in-2026).
