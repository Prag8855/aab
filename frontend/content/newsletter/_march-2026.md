### The weird thing with Apotheken

In Germany, you can't buy ibuprofen or [hay fever](/guides/hay-fever) medicine from dm, Rossmann or budni, only from an *Apotheke*.

There are three categories of medicine in Germany:

- **Prescription medicine** (*verschreibungspflichtiges Arzneimittel*)  
    Sold by an *Apotheke*, requires a prescription from a doctor. This includes most "serious" medication, like antidepressants and stronger pain killers.
- **Pharmacy medicine** (*apothekenpflichtiges Arzneimittel*)  
    Sold by an *Apotheke* without a prescription. This includes medicine with mild side effects like ibuprofen, antihistamines and mild ointments.
- **Over-the-counter medicine** (*freiverkäufliches Arzneimittel*)  
    You can buy it anywhere, without a prescription. This includes medicine with no side effects like teas and oils.

Because of this monopoly on medicine sales, you must go to a different place to buy basic medicine, usually at an inflated price. Yet pharmacies are not rolling in dough; they're closing in droves.[^2] No one benefits and everyone is unhappy.[^3]

Online pharmacies are a weird development of this system. You can't buy medicine from dm, *but* you can buy it from their website, because it's sold by dm-med, an online pharmacy run by dm.

Then things get weirder. You see, online pharmacies can offer in-store pickup.[^1] You could buy ibuprofen on dm.de, and pick it up at the dm store. That would be perfectly legal. However, you couldn't walk into a dm and buy ibuprofen, because *that* would be illegal.
