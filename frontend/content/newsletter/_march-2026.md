## What's new in Berlin

### Digital freelance visa

The Berlin immigration office has digitalized the freelance visa application process. Instead of dumping your documents into a general mailbox, your application now goes into a proper application tracking system.

This should help reduce the wait times and prevent applications from falling in the cracks. It has worked well for the Blue Card and the work visa. These digital forms are not perfect, but they are a step forward.

### Residence permit downgrade

There have been a few reports of people getting a residence permit sticker in their passport, instead of a plastic card. The reason? Budget problems. Issuing residence permit stickers is [unlawful](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verordnung_(EG)_Nr._1030/2002_(Einheitlicher_Aufenthaltstitel)), and it creates serious problems for immigrants, as they often need a plastic residence card to open a bank account and access digital government services.

## What's new on All About Berlin

### Open source

All About Berlin is now source-available. The content, templates and backend are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/All-About-Berlin/aab). I hope that this will encourage others to contribute to the website.

I had wanted to do this for a long time, but I did not want to compete with unauthorised copies of my own work. This has happened anyway with ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews, so I have decided to make the code public.

### New tools

To make it easier to end your lease, I created a [lease notice period calculator](/guides/moving-out#calculate-your-notice-period) and a [termination letter generator](/guides/moving-out#send-a-termination-letter).

### Public holidays

I rewrote my [public holidays guide](/guides/public-holidays). It automatically calculates and shows public holidays for the next 3 years. It even shows which public holidays fall on a weekend.

## What I learned this month

### The weird thing with Apotheken

In Germany, you can't buy ibuprofen or [hay fever](/guides/hay-fever) medicine from dm, Rossmann or budni, only from an *Apotheke*.

There are three categories of medicine in Germany:

- **Prescription medicine** (*verschreibungspflichtiges Arzneimittel*)  
    Sold by an *Apotheke*, requires a prescription from a doctor. This includes most "serious" medication, like antidepressants and stronger pain killers.
- **Pharmacy medicine** (*apothekenpflichtiges Arzneimittel*)  
    Sold by an *Apotheke* without a prescription. This includes medicine with mild side effects like ibuprofen, antihistamines and mild ointments.
- **Over-the-counter medicine** (*freiverkäufliches Arzneimittel*)  
    You can buy it anywhere, without a prescription. This includes medicine with no side effects like teas and oils.

Because of this monopoly on medicine sales, you must go to a different place to buy basic medicine, usually at an inflated price. Yet pharmacies are not rolling in dough; they're closing in droves.[^2] No one benefits and everyone is unhappy.[^3]

Online pharmacies are a weird development of this system. You can't buy medicine from dm, *but* you can buy it from their website, because it's sold by dm-med, an online pharmacy run by dm.

Then things get weirder. You see, online pharmacies can offer in-store pickup.[^1] You could buy ibuprofen on dm.de, and pick it up at the dm store. That would be perfectly legal. However, you couldn't walk into a dm and buy ibuprofen, because *that* would be illegal.
