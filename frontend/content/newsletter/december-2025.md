## Christmas markets tip

If the big crowd at Schloss Charlottenburg is not your thing, why not try other markets further afield? I use [this calendar](https://charles.pizza/berlin-xmas/) and [this map](https://weihnachtsmaerkte.odis-berlin.de/?id=&lang=en) to discover new ones.

## Big changes coming in 2026

New year, new laws, new prices. These are the big changes I noticed while preparing [All About Berlin](https://allaboutberlin.com) for 2026:

- 💺 More expensive public transit: €63 Deutschland Ticket, €4 AB ticket, €5 ABC ticket
- 🍽️ Reduced VAT in cafés and restaurants: previously 19%, now 7%
- 💶 Higher minimum wage: previously €12.82, now €13.90 per hour
- 👷‍♀️ Higher minimum salary for [Blue Cards](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/blue-card): previously €48,300, now €50,700
- 👨‍💻 Higher income requirement for [freelance visas](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/freelance-visa) and student visas.
- 🩹 More expensive health insurance; the starkest price hike in years. Use my [health insurance calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see the new prices. [Ask my health insurance expert](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) if switching to another insurance makes sense.

## Nebenkostenabrechnung deadline

If you don’t receive your <u>2024</u> [*Nebenkostenabrechnung*](https://allaboutberlin.com/glossary/Nebenkostenabrechnung) by December 31, you can ignore it. Your landlord can’t make claims after that date.

These *Nebenkostenabrechnungen* often contain errors and invalid claims. If you are in a Mieterverein or you have legal insurance, you can get yours checked for free. You can also use legaltech services like Mineko.

## Pay less income tax

December is the time to max out your pension contributions. If you had a good year, put some of your income in a pension before the end of the year. Pension contributions are [tax-deductible](https://allaboutberlin.com/glossary/steuerlich%20absetzbar), so they lower your taxable income.

For example, if you earned €100,000, and you put €20,000 in a Rürup pension, your taxable income is €80,000. You would pay €9,700 less income tax.

You will pay income tax on your retirement income. Your income after retirement will be much lower, so you will pay a lot less income tax then.

## Lots of Kita spots

Finding a Kita used to be damn near impossible. Children were put on waiting lists before they were even born. A cottage industry helped parents spam every Kita with a request for a spot.

Now, there are too many spots, and not enough children. Some Kitas must even lay off staff or close.

I have updated my [Kita](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/kita) and [Kitagutschein](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/kitagutschein) guides. Two experts will review them this week.

## Immigration office wait times

Since last winter, I [collect feedback](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/auslanderbehorde-wait-times) from residence permit applicants. This helps you predict Ausländerbehörde delays and plan around them. In September, I started measuring [citizenship processing times](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/citizenship-wait-times) too.

Last week, I made the page easier to read and added two useful pieces of information:

With this information, I can send you instructions just before your residence permit expires. I can also recommend health insurance that the immigration office is guaranteed to accept. Health insurance is one of the main reasons for freelance visa rejections.

## Coming soon on All About Berlin

I am writing a checklist for leaving Germany. There are many little details that are not covered elsewhere: how to close your business, get your money out, receive your pension abroad, etc.

I got access to a *lot* of housing data from [Stekkies](https://www.stekkies.com/en-de/) and [Homeboy](https://www.homeboy.immo/). I want to create helpful tools and visualizations to help with your apartment search. Here’s a sneak peak:
