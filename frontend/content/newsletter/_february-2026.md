## What's happening in February

Nothing! February is the quietest month of the year. There are no [public holidays](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/public-holidays) and no [shopping Sundays](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/open-on-sundays-in-berlin), and although the days are slowly getting longer, it's still too damn cold. It's a great time to travel and wait the winter out in a sunnier place.

There are still a few good reasons to stick around:

- [Berlin Fashion Week](https://fashionweek.berlin/) - January 30 to February 2
- [Berlin Independent Film Festival](https://www.berlinfest.com/) - February 5 to 8
- [Berlinale film festival](https://www.berlinale.de/en/home.html) - February 12 to 22
- [Cologne Carnival](https://www.cologne-tourism.com/experiences-lifestyle/carnival) - February 13 to 15

Oh, and make sure that you get your *[[Meldebescheinigung zur Sozialversicherung]]* this month. Your employer must send it to you every year in January or February.

## New guide: [how to leave Germany](/guides/leaving-germany)

[A third of immigrants are thinking of leaving](https://www.dezim-institut.de/publikationen/auswanderung-im-fokus-wer-bleibt-wer-will-gehen/). Half of them seek to improve their standard of living. I have just released a guide for leaving Germany.

**[How to leave Germany ➞](/guides/leaving-germany)**

Some guides cover tasks while others cover journeys. Leaving Germany is a journey, so this new guide is mostly a checklist that links to existing guides. However, it also clarifies what happens to your health insurance and your residence permit, and it demystifies the exit tax.

### The exit tax

The exit tax is why this guide took four weeks to write. I have read about it for days, then validated my understanding with [my delightfully plain-spoken tax advisor](https://stb-goeydeniz.de/).

The conclusion is simple: the exit tax probably does not apply to you, and if it does, you already have a tax advisor to talk to.

Oliver Eidel also created [an entire website about the exit tax](https://wegzugsteuer.info/). It's based on his own chats with tax advisors, and it's refreshingly straightforward.

### What else is new?

When I write a new guide, I also rewrite everything around it. I have revamped my [*Abmeldung*](/guides/abmeldung) and [address change](/guides/address-change) guides for brevity and clarity. I added a few glossary entries, rewritten a dozen sections, and improved the paths between related guides.

## Up next: labour law

I am teaming up with labour lawyers to help you enforce your rights. I have heard too many stories about immigrants being wrongfully terminated or pressured to sign documents they should not sign.

This is what I plan to cover:

- Common tricks employers pull on immigrant employees
- How to resist wrongful termination
- How to negotiate a better settlement during layoffs
- How to work with your Betriebsrat, your union, lawyers and your legal insurance

Want to help? [Contact me.](/contact) I want to hear your stories, your questions and your advice.

## Kettle cleaning

It took me 9 years to buy a kettle, and another year to learn how to properly descale it. Everyone has their blind spots.

It's simple: just boil a bit of vinegar in your kettle, and the scale comes right off. Vinegar is also an effective bathroom cleaner. Unclog your shower head by wrapping it in a plastic bag filled with vinegar.
