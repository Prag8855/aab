## What's happening in February

Nothing! February is the quietest month of the year. There are no [public holidays](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/public-holidays) and no [shopping Sundays](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/open-on-sundays-in-berlin), and although the days are slowly getting longer, it's still too damn cold. It's a great time to travel and wait the winter out in a sunnier place.

There are still a few good reasons to stick around:

- [Berlin Fashion Week](https://fashionweek.berlin/) - January 30 to February 2
- [Berlin Independent Film Festival](https://www.berlinfest.com/) - February 5 to 8
- [Berlinale film festival](https://www.berlinale.de/en/home.html) - February 12 to 22
- [Cologne Carnival](https://www.cologne-tourism.com/experiences-lifestyle/carnival) - February 13 to 15

Oh, and make sure that you get your *[[Meldebescheinigung zur Sozialversicherung]]* this month. Your employer must send it to you every year in January or February.

## New guide: [how to leave Germany](/guides/leaving-germany)

[A third of immigrants are thinking of leaving](https://www.dezim-institut.de/publikationen/auswanderung-im-fokus-wer-bleibt-wer-will-gehen/). Half of them seek to improve their standard of living.

I have just published [a guide for leaving Germany](/guides/leaving-germany). It mostly refers to existing guides, but it also covers obscure topics like the exit tax. I also revamped my [*Abmeldung* guide](/guides/abmeldung). It's shorter and clearer.

## Apartment affordability test

Graham at BerlinRelo has built [an apartment affordability calculator](https://www.berlinrelo.de/#calculator). It tells you what kind of apartment you can afford, and how long your flat search should take.

## What I have learned this month

### The weird thing with Apotheken

In Germany, you can't buy ibuprofen or [hay fever](/guides/hay-fever) medicine from dm, Rossmann or budni, only from an *Apotheke*.

There are three categories of medicine in Germany:

- **Prescription medicine** (*verschreibungspflichtiges Arzneimittel*)  
    Sold by an *Apotheke*, requires a prescription from a doctor. This includes most "serious" medication, like antidepressants and stronger pain killers.
- **Pharmacy medicine** (*apothekenpflichtiges Arzneimittel*)  
    Sold by an *Apotheke* without a prescription. This includes medicine with mild side effects like ibuprofen, antihistamines and mild ointments.
- **Over-the-counter medicine** (*freiverkäufliches Arzneimittel*)  
    You can buy it anywhere, without a prescription. This includes medicine with no side effects like teas and oils.

Because of this monopoly on medicine sales, you must go to a different place to buy basic medicine, usually at an inflated price. Yet pharmacies are not rolling in dough; they're closing in droves.[^2] No one benefits and everyone is unhappy.[^3]

Online pharmacies are a weird development of this system. You can't buy medicine from dm, *but* you can buy it from their website, because it's sold by dm-med, an online pharmacy run by dm.

Then things get weirder. You see, online pharmacies can offer in-store pickup.[^1] You could buy ibuprofen on dm.de, and pick it up at the dm store. That would be perfectly legal. However, you couldn't walk into a dm and buy ibuprofen, because *that* would be illegal.

### Kettle cleaning

Everyone has their blind spots. I waited 9 years to buy a kettle, boiling my water in a pot like a savage. It took me another year to figure out how to clean it.

It's simple: just boil a bit of vinegar, and the scale comes right off. Vinegar is also a very effective bathroom cleaner. You can pour it in a plastic bag, and dip your shower head in it to unclog it.
