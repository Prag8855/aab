A *WG* or *Wohngemeinschaft* is an apartment where multiple people live together and share the rent. It's called a shared apartment or flatshare in English. Living in a WG is cheaper than living alone, so it's a good way to pay less rent. Most WGs are listed on [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/) and [Kleinanzeigen](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/berlin/).
