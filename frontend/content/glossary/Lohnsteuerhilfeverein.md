A *Lohnsteuerhilfeverein* is a non-profit organisation that helps people with their taxes. If you are a member, they can help you [file your taxes](/glossary/Steuererklärung), apply for *[[Kindergeld]]*, choose your [tax class](/glossary/Steuerklasse) and more.[^1]

They are cheaper than a tax advisor (*[[Steuerberater]]*), but also less qualified.
