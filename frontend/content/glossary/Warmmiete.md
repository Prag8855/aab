The warm rent (*Warmmiete*) is your total monthly rent. It includes your cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) and utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*). It might not include electricity for your lights and appliances.

> Cold rent (*Kaltmiete*) + utilities (*Nebenkosten*) = warm rent (*Warmmiete*)

Your warm rent is adjusted every year, because your utility costs (*Nebenkosten*) can change based on your usage.
