The warm rent (*Warmmiete*) is the rent you pay every month. It's your cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*) plus utilities (*[[Nebenkosten]]*).

> Cold rent (*Kaltmiete*) + utilities (*Nebenkosten*) = warm rent (*Warmmiete*)

Your warm rent is adjusted every year, because your utility costs (*Nebenkosten*) can change based on your usage.
