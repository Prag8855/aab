When you have children, you can get €{{KINDERGELD|cur}} per month from the state.[^1] This is called *Kindergeld*. You don't get it automatically; you must apply for it. If you don't apply for *Kindergeld*, you get the *[Kinderfreibetrag](/glossary/Kindergeld)* instead.

Sometimes, *Kindergeld* makes more sense. Sometimes the *[Kinderfreibetrag](/glossary/Kindergeld)* makes more sense. It depends on your tax situation.
