In Germany, you end most contracts by sending a cancellation letter (*Kündigungsschreiben*). It's also called a termination notice or resignation letter.

Cancellation letters are used to...

- [Resign from a job](/guides/losing-your-job)
- [End an apartment lease](/guides/moving-out#end-your-lease)
- Cancel a subscription or membership

The *Kündigungsschreiben* is usually printed, signed, and sent by [registered mail](/glossary/Einschreibebrief). In many cases, it can be sent by email instead.
