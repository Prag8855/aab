Every month, your employer deducts salary tax (*Lohnsteuer*) from your paycheck. Salary tax is a prepayment for [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer).

When you file a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung), you calculate your real income tax. If you paid more salary tax than your real income tax, you get money back.
