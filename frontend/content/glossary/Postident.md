*Postident* lets you verify your identity at the post office. You might need it to [open a bank account](/guides/best-bank-germany) if verification by video call does not work.

With Postident, you print a document, go to the post office and show your passport. Then the post office tells the company that your identity is verified. Postident does not support all passport types.
