A net profit assessment (*Netto-Gewinnermittlung*) is a document that shows how much profit a business makes. It proves your self-employment income when you [renew a freelance visa](/guides/renew-german-freelance-visa) or [apply for an apartment](/guides/find-a-flat-in-berlin#apply-for-the-apartment).

Usually, it must be stamped by a [tax advisor](/glossary/Steuerberater), to prove that it's correct. If you don't have a tax advisor, get a *Netto-Gewinnermittlung* from [Tax Germany](/out/taxgermany).
