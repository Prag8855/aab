Some expenses are tax-deductible (*steuerlich absetzbar*). Your taxable income does not include the money you spent on those things.

For example, if you earn €50,000 per year, and you have a €10,000 tax-deductible expense, your taxable income is €40,000. You only pay [income tax](/glossary/Einkommensteuer) on €40,000.

[Health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung), business expenses and some pension payments are tax-deductible. [Tax software](/guides/german-tax-software) and [tax advisors](/glossary/Steuerberater) can help you file a [tax declaration](/glossary/Steuererklärung) and declare your tax-deductible expenses.
