When you move out of Germany, you must deregister your address. This is called the *Abmeldung*.

When you deregister, you get a deregistration certificate (*[[Abmeldebescheinigung]]*). You can use this certificate to stop paying TV tax, cancel your contracts, and stop paying for health insurance.

In Berlin, you can do your *Abmeldung* by post, by email, or in person at the *[[Bürgeramt]]*. You can also [pay someone to do it for you](/out/deregistrationde-abmeldung).
