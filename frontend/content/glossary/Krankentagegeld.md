If you are too sick to work, your employer pays your full salary for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, you stop getting paid.

*Krankentagegeld* is an **optional add-on** for your [private health insurance](/glossary/private%20Krankenversicherung). It gives you an income if you are sick for more than 6 weeks. You can choose how much money you get.

If you have [public health insurance](/glossary/gesetzliche%20Krankenversicherung), you get *[[Krankengeld]]* instead.
