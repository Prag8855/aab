An *Anwartschaft* is something you get when you [leave Germany](/guides/leaving-germany), but plan to return.

With an *Anwartschaft* you pay a monthly fee to pause your health insurance. When you come back to Germany, you can resume your health insurance. You get the same tariff and coverage, even if your situation or your health have changed.

Without an *Anwartschaft*, it can be hard to find affordable health insurance.
