Utility costs (*Nebenkosten*) are services that are included in your [warm rent](/glossary/Warmmiete).

Usually, these services are included in your *Nebenkosten*:

- Heating
- Hot water (most of the time)
- Trash collection
- Cleaning and landscaping

These services are sometimes excluded:

- Electricity for your lights and appliances
- Hot water from a flow heater (*Durchlauferhitzer*)

You pay the *estimated* utility costs every month with the rent. Every year, your landlord calculates the real costs, and sends you a bill (the *[[Nebenkostenabrechnung]]*). If you paid too much *Nebenkosten*, you get money back. If you did not pay enough, you get an invoice.
