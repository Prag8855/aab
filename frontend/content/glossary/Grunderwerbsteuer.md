The property transfer tax (*Grunderwerbsteuer* or *GrESt*) is a tax you pay when you buy real estate in Germany. The tax is 3.5% to 6.5% of the value of the property.[^0] The exact amount varies between states. In Berlin, it's 6%.[^1]

The real estate transfer tax is not the same as the [property tax (*Grundsteuer*)](/glossary/Grundsteuer).
