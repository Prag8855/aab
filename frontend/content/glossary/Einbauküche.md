In Germany, apartments do not always come with a furnished kitchen. The kitchen will be completely empty. You must install your own kitchen counter and sink.

*Einbauküche* or *EBK* means that the apartment comes with a furnished kitchen. This usually includes a countertop, a sink, and a stove. It might include a fridge and a dishwasher.
