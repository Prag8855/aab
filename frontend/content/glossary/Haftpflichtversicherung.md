If you cause financial damage to other people, liability insurance (*Haftpflichtversicherung*) pays for fixing the damages.

For example:

- You scratch someone's car with your shopping cart.
- Your child breaks something at someone else's house.
- Your computer chair destroys the floor in the apartment you rent.
- Someone slips in your driveway and breaks their leg.

If someone gets hurt because of you, you might pay thousands or even millions of euros in reparations. This is why liability insurance is so important.

83% of Germans have liability insurance.[^0] It costs around €5 per month. I got mine from [Feather](/out/feather-haftpflicht)
