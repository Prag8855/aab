The *Ringbahn* is a railroad that runs around Berlin. The S41 train goes around the *Ringbahn* in one direction, while the S42 goes in the opposite direction. The *Ringbahn* is often used to separate what's in central Berlin, and what is not.

The area inside the *Ringbahn* is an [environmental zone](https://www.berlin.de/en/tourism/travel-information/1760452-2862820-environmental-zone.en.html). Only low-emission vehicles with [green stickers](https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/) can drive in this area.
