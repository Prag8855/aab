The notice period (*Kündigungsfrist*) is how long you need to cancel a contract, fire an employee, or [quit your job](/guides/losing-your-job).

All jobs have a notice period, both for the employee (when they quit) and the employer (when they fire someone).[^0] It depends on your work contract, and how long you work at that company.

Apartment leases usually have a 3-month notice period. It starts when the landlord receives your cancellation letter. You must pay rent until the end of the notice period.

Many other contracts have a notice period. In some cases, you can cancel a contract early if there is a price increase, you [leave Germany](/guides/leaving-germany), or you move where the service is not available.[^1] This is called a *Sonderkündigung*.
