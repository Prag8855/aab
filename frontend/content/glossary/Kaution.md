The apartment deposit (*Kaution*, *Mietkaution* or *Mietsicherheit*) pays for repairs after you [move out of an apartment](/guides/moving-out). If there is nothing to repair, you get your full *Kaution* back.

You give the *Kaution* to your landlord when you [move into an apartment](/guides/moving-in). It's usually 3 times your cold rent (*[[Kaltmiete]]*). It can't be more than that.
