A direct debit authorization (*SEPA-Lastschriftmandat*) allows a company to automatically take money from your bank account. You can use it to pay your bills and your taxes automatically.

Direct debit authorizations are often used to pay for the [TV tax](/glossary/Rundfunkbeitrag), the [vehicle tax](/glossary/Kraftfahrzeugsteuer) and [health insurance](/glossary/Krankenversicherung). Freelancers often pay taxes that way.
