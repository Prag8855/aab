If you own a car in Germany, you must pay a vehicle tax (*Kraftfahrzeugsteuer* or *Kfz-Steuer*) every year. The cost depends on the type of the vehicle, and the size of its engine.

You get a vehicle tax statement (*[[Kraftfahrzeugsteuerbescheid]]*) every year by post. It tells you how much vehicle tax you must pay.
