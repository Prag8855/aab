A SEPA transfer (*SEPA-Überweisung*) is a free, instant bank transfer. It works between all European banks. It's the most common way to send money in Germany. It's how your employer pays you, and how you pay your rent.

You can make a SEPA transfer at the bank, in your banking app, or with online banking. You can also sign a [direct debit authorization](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat) to allow automatic SEPA transfers.

If you can't make a SEPA transfer, use [Wise](/out/wise), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) or wire transfers.
