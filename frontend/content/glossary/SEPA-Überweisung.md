A SEPA transfer (*SEPA-Überweisung*) is how you transfer money between European banks. These bank transfers are free, and take around 2 business days. It's the most common way to send money in Germany. It's how your employer pays you, and how you pay the rent.

You can make a SEPA transfer at the bank, in your banking app, or with online banking. You can also sign a [direct debit authorization](/glossary/SEPA-Lastschriftmandat).

If you can't make a SEPA transfer, use [Wise](/out/wise), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/) or wire transfers.
