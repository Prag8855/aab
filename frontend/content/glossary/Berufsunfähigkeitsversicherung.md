Job disability insurance (*Berufsunfähigkeitsversicherung*) gives you an income if you are too sick or injured to work. It covers you after you stop getting [paid sick leave](/glossary/Krankengeld). It's also called income protection insurance.

Disability insurance replaces your income if...

- You have cancer
- You suffer from burn out
- You can't work after an accident
- You can't do your normal job because of a disability

Disability insurance makes sense if your family depends on your income, or if you have a mortgage. It costs €50 to €150 per month.[^1]{{ fail_on('2026-12-31') }}
